##  Alligator food


 What do alligators most like to eat? 219 alligators were captured
in four Florida lakes. Each alligator's stomach contents were
observed, and the food that the alligator had eaten  was classified
into one of five categories: fish, invertebrates (such as snails or
insects), reptiles (such as turtles), birds, and "other" (such as
amphibians, plants or rocks). The researcher noted for each alligator
what that alligator had most of in its stomach, as well as the gender
of each alligator and whether it was "large" or "small" (greater
or less than 2.3 metres in length). The data can be found in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/alligator.txt). The
numbers in the data set (apart from the first column) are all
frequencies. (You can ignore that first column "profile".)

Our aim is to predict food type from the other variables.



(a) Read in the data and display the first few lines. Describe
how the data are not "tidy".



(b) Use `pivot_longer` to arrange the data
suitably for analysis (which will be using
`multinom`). Demonstrate (by looking at the first few rows
of your new data frame) that you now have something tidy.



(c) What is different about this problem, compared to
Question <a href="#q:abortion">here</a>, that would make 
`multinom` the right tool to use?



(d) Fit a suitable multinomial model predicting food type from
gender, size and lake. Does each row represent one alligator or more
than one? If more than one, account for this in your modelling.



(e) Do a test to see whether `Gender` should stay in
the model. (This will entail fitting another model.) What do you conclude?



(f) Predict the probability that an alligator
prefers each food type, given its size, gender (if necessary) and
the lake it was found 
in, using the more appropriate of the two models that you have
fitted so far.  This means (i) 
making a data frame for prediction, and (ii) obtaining and
displaying the predicted probabilities in a way that is easy to read.



(g) What do you think is the most important way in which the
lakes differ? (Hint: look at where the biggest predicted
probabilities are.)



(h) How would you describe the major difference between the
diets of the small and large alligators?
