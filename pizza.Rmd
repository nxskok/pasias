##  Calories and fat in pizza


 
The file at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/Pizza.csv) 
came from a spreadsheet of information about 24 brands
of pizza: specifically, per 5-ounce serving, the number of calories,
the grams of fat, and the cost (in US dollars). The names of the pizza
brands are quite long. This file may open in a spreadsheet when you
browse to the link, depending on your computer's setup.



(a) Read in the data and display at least some of the data
frame. Are the variables of the right types? (In particular, why is
the number of calories labelled one way and the cost labelled a
different way?)

Solution


`read_csv` is the thing this time:
```{r }
my_url <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/Pizza.csv"
pizza <- read_csv(my_url)
pizza
```

    

The four variables are: the brand of pizza, which got read in as text,
the number of calories (an integer), and the fat and cost, which are
both decimal numbers so they get labelled `dbl`, which is short for 
"double-precision floating point number". 

Anyway, these are apparently the right thing. 

Extra: I wanted to mention something else that I discovered
yesterday.
`r tufte::margin_note("R is like that: sometimes it seems as if it has  infinite depth.")` 
There is a package called `rio` that will
read (and write) data in a whole bunch of different formats in a
unified way.
`r tufte::margin_note("It does this by figuring what kind of thing you have, from the extension to its filename, and then calling an appropriate function to read in or write out the data. This is an excellent example of *standing on the shoulders of giants* to make our lives easier. The software does the hard work of figuring out what kind of thing you have and how to read it in; all we do is say *import*.")` Anyway, the usual installation thing, done once:

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("rio")
```

 

which takes a moment since it probably has to install some other
packages too, and then you read in a file like this:

```{r }
library(rio)
pizza3 <- import(my_url)
head(pizza3)
```

 

`import` figures that you have a `.csv` file, so it
calls up `read_csv` or similar.

Technical note: `rio` does not use the `read_`
functions, so what it gives you is actually a `data.frame`
rather than a `tibble`, so that when you display it, you get
the whole thing even if it is long. Hence the `head` here and
below to display the first six lines.

I originally had the data as an Excel spreadsheet, but `import`
will gobble up that pizza too:

```{r }
my_other_url <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/Pizza_E29.xls"
pizza4 <- import(my_other_url)
head(pizza4)
```

 

The corresponding function for writing a data frame to a file in the
right format is, predictably enough, called `export`.


(b) Make a scatterplot for predicting calories from the number
of grams of fat. Add a smooth trend. What kind of relationship do
you see, if any?

Solution


All the variable names start with Capital Letters:
```{r alskhslafkhlksfhsasvvvv}
ggplot(pizza, aes(x = Fat, y = Calories)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

       

There is definitely an upward trend: the more fat, the more
calories. The trend is more or less linear (or, a little bit curved:
say what you like, as long as it's not obviously crazy). *I*
think, with this much scatter, there's no real justification for
fitting a curve.
 

(c) Fit a straight-line relationship, and display the intercept,
slope, R-squared, etc. Is there a real relationship between the two
variables, or is any apparent trend just chance?

Solution


`lm`, with `summary`:
```{r }
pizza.1 <- lm(Calories ~ Fat, data = pizza)
summary(pizza.1)
```

       

To assess whether this trend is real or just chance, look at the
P-value on the end of the `Fat` line, or on the bottom line
where the $F$-statistic is (they are the same value of $1.73\times
10^{-6}$ or 0.0000017, so you can pick either). This P-value is
really small, so the slope is definitely *not* zero, and
therefore there really is a relationship between the two variables.
 

(d) Obtain a plot of the residuals against the fitted values
for this regression. Does this indicate that there are any problems
with this regression, or not? Explain briefly.

Solution


Use the regression object `pizza.1`:

```{r }
ggplot(pizza.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

 

On my residual plot, I see a slight curve in the smooth trend,
but I am not worried about that because the residuals on the plot are
all over the place in a seemingly random pattern (the grey envelope is
wide and that is pretty close to going straight across). So I think a
straight line model is satisfactory. 

That's all you needed, but it is also worth looking at a normal
quantile plot of the residuals:

```{r }
ggplot(pizza.1, aes(sample = .resid)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```

 

A bit skewed to the left (the low ones are too low).

Also a plot of the absolute residuals, for assessing fan-out:

```{r }
ggplot(pizza.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = abs(.resid))) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

 

A tiny bit of fan-in (residuals getting *smaller* in size as the
fitted value gets bigger), but nothing much, I think.

Another way of assessing curvedness is to fit a squared term anyway,
and see whether it is significant:

```{r }
pizza.2 <- update(pizza.1, . ~ . + I(Fat^2))
summary(pizza.2)
```

 

The fat-squared term is not significant, so that curve on the smooth trend
in the (first) residual plot was indeed nothing to get excited about.
 

(e) The research assistant in this study returns with two
new brands of pizza (ones that were not in the original data). The
fat content of a 5-ounce serving was 12 grams for the first brand
and 20 grams for the second brand. For each of these brands of
pizza, obtain a suitable 95\% interval for the number of calories
contained in a 5-ounce serving.

Solution


The suitable interval here is a prediction interval, because we
are interested in each case in the calorie content of the
*particular* pizza brands that the research assistant
returned with (and not, for example, in the mean calorie content
for *all* brands of pizza that have 12 grams of fat per
serving). Thus:
```{r }
newfat <- c(12, 20)
new <- tibble(Fat = newfat)
new
preds <- predict(pizza.1, new, interval = "p")
cbind(new, preds)
```

       

Or, if you like:

```{r }
as_tibble(preds) %>% bind_cols(new) %>% select(Fat, everything())
```

 

For the pizza with 12 grams of fat, the predicted calories are between
261 and 370 with 95\% confidence, and for the pizza with 20 grams of
fat, the calories are predicted to be between 337 and 454. (You should
write down what these intervals are, and not leave the reader to find
them in the output.)

(Remember the steps: create a new data frame containing the values to
predict for, and then feed that into `predict` along with the
model that you want to use to predict with. The variable in the data
frame has to be called *precisely* `Fat` with a capital F,
otherwise it won't work.)

These intervals are both pretty awful: you get a very weak picture of
how many calories per serving the pizza brands in question might
contain. This is for two reasons: (i) there was a fair bit of scatter
in the original relationship, R-squared being around 65\%, and (ii)
even if we knew perfectly where the line went (which we don't),
there's no guarantee that individual brands of pizza would be on it
anyway. (Prediction intervals are always hit by this double whammy, in
that individual observations suffer from variability in where the line
goes *and* variability around whatever the line is.)

I was expecting, when I put together this question, that the
20-grams-of-fat interval would  be noticeably worse, because 20 is
farther away from the mean fat content of all the brands. But there
isn't much to choose. For the confidence intervals for the mean
calories of *all* brands with these fat contents, the picture is clearer:

```{r }
preds <- predict(pizza.1, new, interval = "c")
cbind(new, preds)
```

 

or, as before:

```{r }
as_tibble(preds) %>% bind_cols(new) %>% select(Fat, everything())
```

 

This time the fat-20 interval is noticeably longer than the fat-12
one. And these are much shorter than the prediction intervals, as we
would guess.

This question is a fair bit of work for 3 points, so I'm not insisting that you explain
your choice of a prediction interval over a confidence interval, but I
think it is still a smart thing to do, even purely from a marks point
of view, because if you get it wrong for a semi-plausible reason, you
might pick up some partial credit. Not pulling out your prediction
intervals from your output is a sure way to lose a point, however.
