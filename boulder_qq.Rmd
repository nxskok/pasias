##  Buses to Boulder


 A bus line operates a route from Denver to Boulder (these
places are in Colorado). The
schedule says that the journey time should be 60 minutes. 11
randomly chosen journey times were recorded, and these are in the
file [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/buses.txt), with
journey times shown in minutes.


(a) Read the data into R, and display the data frame that you
read in.
 

(b) Run a suitable test to see whether there is evidence that
the mean journey time differs from 60 minutes. What do you
conclude? (I want a conclusion that says something about journey
times of buses.)
 

(c) Give a 95\% confidence interval for the mean journey
time. (No R code is needed here.)
 

(d) Do you draw consistent conclusions from your test and
confidence interval? Explain briefly.
 

(e) Draw a boxplot of the journey times. Do you see a reason
to doubt the test that you did above?
