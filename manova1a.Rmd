##  Understanding a MANOVA


 One use of discriminant analysis is to
understand the results of a MANOVA. This question is a followup to a
previous MANOVA that we did, the one with two variables `y1`
and `y2` and three groups `a` through `c`. The
data were in [link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/simple-manova.txt).



(a) Read the data in again and run the MANOVA that you did
before. 


Solution


This is an exact repeat of what you did before:
```{r }
my_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/simple-manova.txt"
simple <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
simple
response <- with(simple, cbind(y1, y2))
simple.3 <- manova(response ~ group, data = simple)
summary(simple.3)
```

     

This P-value is small, so there is some way in which some of the
groups differ on some of the variables.
`r tufte::margin_note("That sounds like the  ultimate in evasiveness!")`
    


(b) Run a discriminant analysis "predicting" group from the
two response variables. Display the output.


Solution


This:
```{r }
simple.4 <- lda(group ~ y1 + y2, data = simple)
simple.4
```

   
Note that this is the other way around from MANOVA: here, we are
"predicting the group" from the response variables, in the same
manner as one of the flavours of logistic regression: 
"what makes the groups different, in terms of those response variables?".

    


(c) <a name="part:output">*</a> In the output from the discriminant analysis,
why are there exactly two linear discriminants `LD1` and
`LD2`?



Solution


There are two linear discriminants because there are 3 groups and two
variables, so there are the smaller of $3-1$ and 2 discriminants.

  


(d) <a name="part:svd">*</a> From the output, how would you say that the
first linear discriminant `LD1` compares in importance to the
second one `LD2`: much more important, more important, equally
important, less important, much less important? Explain briefly. 



Solution


Look at the `Proportion of trace` at the bottom of the output.
The first number is much bigger than the second, so the first linear
discriminant is much more important than the second. (I care about
your reason; you can say it's "more important" rather than 
"much more important" and I'm good with that.) 
  


(e) Obtain a plot of the
discriminant scores.



Solution


This was the old-fashioned way:

```{r }
plot(simple.4)
```

   

It needs cajoling to produce colours, but we can do better. The first
thing is to obtain the predictions:

```{r }
simple.pred <- predict(simple.4)
```

 

Then we make a data frame out of the discriminant scores and the true
groups, using `cbind`:

```{r }
d <- cbind(simple, simple.pred)
head(d)
```

 
or like this, for fun:
`r tufte::margin_note("For suitable definitions of fun.")`

```{r error=T}
ld <- as_tibble(simple.pred$x)
post <- as_tibble(simple.pred$posterior)
dd <- bind_cols(simple, class = simple.pred$class, ld, post)
dd
```

 
After that, we plot the first one against the second one, colouring by
true groups:

```{r error=T}
ggplot(d, aes(x = x.LD1, y = x.LD2, colour = group)) + geom_point()
```

 

I wanted to compare this plot with the original plot of `y1`
vs.\ `y2`, coloured by groups:

```{r }
ggplot(simple, aes(x = y1, y = y2, colour = group)) + geom_point()
```

 

The difference between this plot and the one of `LD1` vs.\
`LD2` is that things have been rotated a bit so that most of
the separation of groups is done by `LD1`. This is reflected in
the fact that `LD1` is quite a bit more important than
`LD2`: the latter doesn't help much in separating the groups.

With that in mind, we could also plot just `LD1`, presumably
against groups via boxplot:

```{r error=T}
ggplot(d, aes(x = group, y = x.LD1)) + geom_boxplot()
```

 

This shows that LD1 does a pretty fine job of separating the groups,
and `LD2` doesn't really have much to add to the picture. 
  


(f) Describe briefly how `LD1` and/or `LD2`
separate the groups. Does your picture confirm the relative importance
of `LD1` and `LD2` that you found  back in part (<a href="#part:svd">here</a>)? Explain briefly.



Solution


`LD1` separates the groups left to right: group `a` is
low on `LD1`, `b` is in the middle and `c` is
high on `LD1`. (There is no intermingling of the groups on
`LD1`, so it separates the groups perfectly.)

As for `LD2`, all it does (possibly) is to distinguish
`b` (low) from `a` and `c` (high). Or you can,
just as reasonably, take the view that it doesn't really separate
any of the groups.

Back in part (<a href="#part:svd">here</a>), you said (I hope) that `LD1`
was (very) important compared to `LD2`. This shows up here in
that `LD1` does a very good job of distinguishing the groups,
while `LD2` does a poor to non-existent job of separating any
groups. (If you didn't
say that before, here is an invitation to reconsider what you
*did* say there.)
  


(g) What makes group `a` have a low score on `LD1`?
There are two steps that you need to make: consider the means of group
`a` on variables `y1` and `y2` and how they
compare to the other groups, and consider how
`y1` and `y2` play into the score on `LD1`.



Solution


The information you need is in the big output.

The means of `y1` and `y2` for group `a` are 3
and 4 respectively, which are the lowest of all the groups. That's
the first thing. 

The second thing is the coefficients of
`LD1` in terms of `y1` and `y2`, which are both
*positive*. That means, for any observation, if its `y1`
and `y2` values are *large*, that observation's score on
`LD1` will be large as well. Conversely, if its values are
*small*, as the ones in group `a` are, its score on
`LD1` will be small. 

You need these two things.

This explains why the group `a` observations are on the left
of the plot. It also explains why the group `c` observations
are on the right: they are *large* on both `y1` and
`y2`, and so large on `LD1`.

What about `LD2`? This is a little more confusing (and thus I
didn't ask you about that). Its "coefficients of linear discriminant" 
are positive on `y1` and negative on
`y2`, with the latter being bigger in size. Group `b`
is about average on `y1` and distinctly *high* on
`y2`; the second of these coupled with the negative
coefficient on `y2` means that the `LD2` score for
observations in group `b` will be *negative*.

For `LD2`, group `a` has a low mean on both variables
and group `c` has a high mean, so for both groups there is a
kind of cancelling-out happening, and neither group `a` nor
group `c` will be especially remarkable on `LD2`.
  


(h) Obtain predictions for the group memberships of each
observation, and make a table of the actual group memberships against
the predicted ones. How many of the observations were wrongly classified?



Solution


Use the
`simple.pred` that you got earlier. This is the
`table` way:
```{r error=T}
with(d, table(obs = group, pred = class))
```

   
Every single one of the 12 observations has been classified into its
correct group. (There is nothing off the diagonal of this table.) 
The alternative to `table` is the `tidyverse` way:

```{r }
d %>% count(group, class)
```

 

or
```{r }
d %>%
  count(group, class) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=class, values_from=n, values_fill = list(n=0))
```

 

if you want something that looks like a frequency table.
All the `a`s got classified as `a`, and so on. 
That's the end of what I asked you to do, but as ever I wanted to
press on. The next question to ask after getting the predicted groups
is "what are the posterior probabilities of being in each group for each observation": 
that is, not just which group do I think it
belongs in, but how sure am I about that call? The posterior
probabilities in my `d` start with `posterior`. These
have a ton of decimal places which I like to round off first before I
display them, eg. to 3 decimals here:
```{r }
d %>%
  select(y1, y2, group, class, starts_with("posterior")) %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("posterior"), ~ round(., 3)))
```

 


You see that the posterior probability of an observation being in the
group it actually *was* in is close to 1 all the way down. The
only one with any doubt at all is observation \#6, which is actually
in group `b`, but has "only" probability 0.814 of being a
`b` based on its `y1` and `y2` values. What else
could it be? Well, it's about equally split between being `a`
and `c`. Let me see if I can display this observation on the
plot in a different way. First I need to make a new column picking out
observation 6, and then I use this new variable as the `size`
of the point I plot:
```{r }
simple %>%
  mutate(is6 = (row_number() == 6)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = y1, y = y2, colour = group, size = is6)) +
  geom_point()
```

 

That makes it stand out.
As the legend indicates, observation \#6 is plotted as a big circle,
with the rest being plotted as small circles as usual. Since observation \#6
is in group `b`, it appears as a big green circle. What makes it
least like a `b`? Well, it has the smallest `y2` value
of any of the `b`'s (which makes it most like an `a` of
any of the `b`'s), and it has the largest `y1` value (which makes it
most like a `c` of any of the `b`'s). But still, it's nearer the
greens than anything else, so it's still more like a `b` than
it is like any of the other groups.
