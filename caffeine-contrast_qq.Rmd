##  Focused comparisons of the effect of caffeine


 
Does caffeine help students do better on a certain test? To
find out, 36 students were randomly allocated to three groups (12 in
each group).  Each student received a fixed number of cups of coffee
while they were studying, but the students didn't know whether they
were receiving all full-strength coffee ("high"), all decaf coffee
("low") or a 50-50 mixture of the two ("moderate"). For each
subject, their group was recorded as well as their score on the
test. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv), as a
`.csv` file.

This time we look at
contrasts. Suppose I knew ahead of time
that I wanted to compare moderate caffeine with high, and any
caffeine with none. (In the latter case, we're comparing 
"no caffeine" against the average of the other two groups.)

In the previous go-through of the caffeine data, we
discovered that `amount` was actually text rather than a
factor, but we also discovered that it *didn't matter*. Here it
does matter, so the first thing we have to do is to re-do the
`pivot_longer`, creating a factor version of `amount`.



(a) Read in the data again, from
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv), and
display it. This is the untidy format, so name it appropriately:



(b) Copy your `pivot_longer` from before, only this time add
`names_ptypes = list(amount=factor())` to the end of it. Take a look at the
results. What has changed from before?



(c) Using the newly tidied caffeine data, run the ANOVA 
*as a  regression* (that is, using `lm`). Look at the
`summary` of the output. What do you see?



(d) Obtain the different values of `amount`, in the order
that R has them.



(e) Create a contrast that compares High with Moderate, ignoring
None. That is, create a vector whose length is the same as the
number of levels of `amount`, and which has a 1 to represent
High and a $-1$ to represent Moderate. 



(f) Create a contrast that compares "any caffeine" against
"none" by comparing None against the average of Moderate and High.



(g) Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.



(h) Arrange your contrasts as columns of a matrix (using
`cbind`), and say that you want to use these as contrasts for
`amount` (in data frame `caffeine` or whatever you
called it).



(i) Fit the ANOVA as an `lm`, and look at the
`summary`. What do you conclude about your contrasts?



(j) What happens if you try to use high caffeine vs.\ moderate
caffeine and moderate vs.\ none as your two contrasts?
