##  Investigating motor activity in rats


 A researcher named King was investigating
the effect of the drug midazolam on motor activity in rats. Typically,
the first time the drug is injected, a rat's motor activity decreases
substantially, but rats typically develop a "tolerance", so that
further injections of the drug have less impact on the rat's motor
activity.

The data shown in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/king.csv) were all taken
in one day, called the "experiment day" below. 24 different rats
were used. Each rat, on the experiment day, was injected with a fixed
amount of midazolam, and at each of six five-minute intervals after
being injected, the rat's motor activity was measured (these are
labelled `i1` through `i6` in the data). The rats
differed in how they had been treated before the experiment day. The
control group of rats had previously been injected repeatedly with a
saline solution (no active ingredient), so the experiment day was the
first time this group of rats had received midazolam. The other two
groups of rats had both received midazolam repeatedly before the
experiment day: the "same" group was injected on experiment day in
the same environment that the previous injections had taken place (this
is known in psychology as a "conditioned tolerance"), but the
"different" group had the previous injections in a different
environment than on experiment day.

The column `id` identifies the rat from which each sequence of
values was obtained.



(a) Explain briefly why we need to use a repeated measures
analysis for these data.



(b) Read in the data and note that you have what was promised
in the question.



(c) We are going to do a repeated-measures analysis using the
"profile" method shown in class. Create a suitable response
variable for this method.



(d) Set up the "within-subjects" part of the analysis. That
means getting hold of the names of the columns that hold the
different times, saving them, and also making a data frame out of them:



(e) Fit the repeated-measures ANOVA. This will involve fitting
an `lm` first, if you have not already done so.



(f) What do you conclude from your repeated-measures ANOVA?
Explain briefly, in the context of the data.



(g) To understand the results of the previous part, we are going
to make a spaghetti plot. In preparation for that, we need to save
the data in "long format" with one observation on *one* time
point in each row. Arrange that, and show by displaying (some of)
the data that you have done so.



(h) Make a spaghetti plot: that is, plot motor activity against
the time points, joining the points for each *rat* by lines,
and colouring the points and lines according to the *context*.



(i) Looking at your spaghetti plot, why do you think your
repeated-measures ANOVA came out as it did? Explain briefly.
