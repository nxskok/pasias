##  Pain relief in migraine headaches (again)


 The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/migraine.txt) are from a
study of pain relief in migraine headaches. Specifically, 27 subjects
were randomly assigned to receive *one* of three pain relieving
drugs, labelled A, B and C. Each subject reported the number of hours
of pain relief they obtained (that is, the number of hours between
taking the drug and the migraine symptoms returning). A higher value
is therefore better. Can we make some recommendation about which drug
is best for the population of migraine sufferers?



(a) Read in and display the data. Take a look at the data
file first, and see if you can say why `read_table` will
work and `read_delim` will not.



(b) What is it about the experimental design that makes a one-way
analysis of variance plausible for data like this?



(c) What is wrong with the current format of the data as far as
doing a one-way ANOVA analysis is concerned? (This is related to the
idea of whether or not the data are "tidy".)



(d) "Tidy" the data to produce a data frame suitable for your
analysis. 



(e) Go ahead and run your one-way ANOVA (and Tukey if
necessary). Assume for this that the pain relief hours in each group
are sufficiently close to normally distributed with sufficiently
equal spreads.



(f) What recommendation would you make about the best drug or
drugs? Explain briefly.
