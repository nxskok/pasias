##  Dealing with dates in the Worcester Heart Attack study


 The Worcester Heart Attack Study is an ongoing study of
heart attacks in the Worcester, MA area. The main purpose of the study
is to investigate changes over time in incidence and death rates, and also
the use of different treatment approaches. We will be mainly using
this data set to investigate data handling and dealing with dates. The
data can be found at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/whas500.txt). 



(a) Read the data into R. The reading-in part is
straightforward, but check what type of thing each column is. Is
that what it should be?



(b) The date columns should be R dates. They are not
year-month-day, so converting them via `as.Date` (which is
what `read_delim` tries to do) will not work. Load the
`lubridate` package, and create new columns in your data
frame that are properly dates. Save your data frame, and list it to
demonstrate that it worked.



(c) Create three new variables `diff1, diff2, diff3` that
are the numbers of days between each of your dates, and save the
data frame in which they have been created. Verify that at
least some of them are the same as `los` and `lenfol`.



(d) Construct side-by-side boxplots of the length of followup by
each followup status. You'll need to make sure
that the followup status, as it gets fed into `ggplot`, is a
`factor`, or, at least, not the number that it is now.
