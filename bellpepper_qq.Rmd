##  Bell peppers and too much water


 A pathogen called *Phytophthora capsici* causes bell
peppers to wilt and die. It is thought that too much water aids in the
spread of the pathogen. Two fields are under study, labelled
`a` and `b`. The first step in the research project is
to compare the mean soil  water content of the two fields.  There is
a suspicion that field `a` will have a higher water content
than field `b`. The data
are in the
file
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/bellpepper.csv).


(a) Read the file in using `read_csv`, and
list the resulting data frame.
 

(b) Make side-by-side boxplots of the water content values for
the two fields. How do the fields seem to compare?
 

(c) Do a two-sample $t$-test to test whether there is evidence
that the mean water
content in field `a` is higher than that of field
`b`. What do you conclude? Explain briefly. (You'll need to
figure out a way of doing a one-sided test, or how to adapt the
results from a two-sided test.)
 

(d) Is the result of your test consistent with the boxplot, or
not? Explain briefly.
