##  Observing children with ADHD


 A number of children with ADHD were observed by their mother
or their father (only one parent observed each child). Each parent was
asked to rate occurrences of behaviours of four different types,
labelled `q1` through `q4` in the data set. Also
recorded was the identity of the parent doing the observation for each
child: 1 is father, 2 is mother.

Can we tell (without looking at the `parent` column) which
parent is doing the observation? Research suggests that rating the
degree of impairment in different categories depends on who is doing
the rating: for example, mothers may feel that a  child has difficulty
sitting still, while fathers, who might do more observing of a child
at play, might think of such a child as simply being "active" or
"just being a kid". The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/adhd-parents.txt). 



(a) Read in the data and confirm that you have four ratings and
a column labelling the parent who made each observation.



(b) Run a suitable discriminant analysis and display the output.



(c) Which behaviour item or items seem to be most helpful at
distinguishing the parent making the observations? Explain briefly.



(d) Obtain the predictions from the `lda`, and make a
suitable plot of the discriminant scores, bearing in mind that you
only have one `LD`.  Do you think there will be any
misclassifications? Explain briefly.



(e) Obtain the predicted group memberships and make a table of
actual vs.\ predicted. Were there any misclassifications? Explain
briefly. 



(f) Re-run the discriminant analysis using cross-validation,
and again obtain a table of actual and predicted parents. Is the
pattern of misclassification different from before? Hints: (i) Bear in mind
that there is no `predict` step this time, because the
cross-validation output includes predictions; (ii) use a different name
for the predictions this time because we are going to do a
comparison in a moment.



(g) Display the original data (that you read in from the data
file) side by side with two sets of posterior probabilities: the
ones that you obtained with `predict` before, and the ones
from the cross-validated analysis. Comment briefly on whether the
two sets of posterior probabilities are similar. Hints: (i) use
`data.frame` rather than `cbind`, for reasons that I
explain elsewhere; (ii) round the posterior probabilities to 3
decimals before you display them.
There are only 29 rows, so look at them all. I am going to add the
`LD1` scores to my output and sort by that, but you don't
need to. (This is for something I am going to add later.)



(h) Row 17 of your (original) data frame above, row 5 of the
output in the previous part, is the mother that was
misclassified as a father. Why is it that the cross-validated
posterior probabilities are 1 and 0, while the previous posterior
probabilities are a bit less than 1 and a bit more than 0?



(i) Find the parents where the cross-validated posterior
probability of being a father is "non-trivial": that is, not
close to zero and not close to 1. (You will have to make a judgement
about what "close to zero or 1" means for you.) What do these
parents have in common, all of them or most of them?
