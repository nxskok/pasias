##  Bikes on College


 The City of Toronto collects all kinds of data on aspects of
life in the city. See
[link](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=1a66e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD). One
collection of data is records of the number of cyclists on certain
downtown streets. The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/bikes.csv) are a record
of the cyclists on College Street on the block west from Huron to
Spadina on September 24, 2010. In the spreadsheet, each row relates to
one cyclist. The first column is the time the cyclist was observed (to
the nearest 15 minutes). After that, there are four pairs of
columns. The observer filled in (exactly) one X in each pair of
columns, according to whether (i) the cyclist was male or female, (ii)
was or was not wearing a helmet, (iii) was or was not carrying a
passenger on the bike, (iv) was or was not riding on the sidewalk. We
want to create a tidy data frame that has the time in each row, and
has columns containing appropriate values, often `TRUE` or
`FALSE`, for each of the four variables measured.

I will lead you through the process, which will involve developing a
(long) pipe, one step at a time.



(a) Take a look at the spreadsheet (using Excel or similar:
this may open when you click the link). Are there any obvious
header rows? Is there any extra material before the data start?
Explain briefly.



(b) Read the data into an R data
frame. Read *without* headers, and instruct R how many lines
to skip over using `skip=` and a suitable number.
When this is working, display the first few lines of your data
frame.  Note that your columns have names `X1` through
`X9`.



(c) What do you notice about the times in your first
column? What do you think those "missing" times should be?


(d) Find something from the `tidyverse` that will
fill^[Oh, what a giveaway.]
in those missing values with the right thing.
Start a pipe from the data frame you read in, that updates the
appropriate column with the filled-in times.



(e) R's `ifelse` function works like `=IF` in
Excel. You use it to create values for a new variable, for
example in a `mutate`.  The first input to it is a
logical condition (something that is either true or false); the
second is the value your new variable should take if the
condition is true, and the third is the value of your new
variable if the condition is false.  Create a new column
`gender` in your data frame that is "male" or
"female" depending on the value of your `X2` column,
using `mutate`. (You can assume that exactly one of the
second and third columns has an `X` in it.) Add your code
to the end of your pipe and display (the first 10 rows of) the
result.




(f) Create variables `helmet`, `passenger` and
`sidewalk` in your data frame that are `TRUE` if
the "Yes" column contains `X` and `FALSE`
otherwise. This will use `mutate` again, but you don't
need `ifelse`: just set the variable equal to the
appropriate logical condition. As before, the best way to
create these variables is to test the appropriate things for
missingness.  Note that you can create as many new variables
as you like in one `mutate`. Show the first few lines
of your new data frame. (Add your code onto the end of the
pipe you made above.)



(g) Finally 
(for the data manipulation), get rid of
all the original columns, keeping only the new ones that
you created. Save the results in a data frame and display
its first few rows.
 


(h) The next few parts are a quick-fire analysis of
the data set. They can all be solved using `count`.
How many male and how many female cyclists were observed
in total?



(i) How many male and female cyclists were not
wearing helmets?



(j) How many cyclists were riding on the sidewalk
*and* carrying a passenger?



(k) What was the busiest 15-minute period of the
day, and how many cyclists were there then?
