##  Where should the fire stations be?


 In city planning, one major issue is where to locate fire
stations. If a city has too many fire stations, it will spend too much
on running them, but if it has too few, there may be unnecessary fire
damage because the fire trucks take too long to get to the fire.

The first part of a study of this kind of issue is to understand the
relationship between the distance from the fire station (measured in
miles in our data set) and the amount of fire damage caused (measured
in thousands of dollars). A city recorded the fire damage and distance
from fire station for 15 residential fires (which you can take as a
sample of "all possible residential fires in that city"). The data
are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/fire_damage.txt). 



(a) Read in and display the data, verifying that you have the
right number of rows and the right columns.




(b) <a name="part:ttest">*</a> Obtain a 95\% confidence interval for the
mean fire damage. (There is nothing here from STAD29, and your
answer should have nothing to do with distance.)



(c) Draw a scatterplot for predicting the amount of fire damage
from the distance from the fire station. Add a smooth trend to your
plot. 



(d) <a name="part:howgood">*</a> Is there a relationship between distance from fire station
and fire damage? Is it linear or definitely curved? How strong is
it? Explain briefly.



(e) Fit a regression predicting fire damage from distance. How
is the R-squared consistent (or inconsistent) with your answer from
part~(<a href="#part:howgood">here</a>)?



(f) <a name="part:cim">*</a> Obtain a 95\% confidence interval for the mean fire damage
\emph{for a residence that is 4 miles from the nearest fire
station}. (Note the contrast with part~(<a href="#part:ttest">here</a>).)



(g) Compare the confidence intervals of parts
(<a href="#part:ttest">here</a>) and (<a href="#part:cim">here</a>). Specifically, compare their
centres and their lengths, and explain briefly why the results
make sense.
