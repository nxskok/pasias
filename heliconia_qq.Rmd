##  Lengths of heliconia flowers


 The tropical flower *Heliconia* is
fertilized by hummingbirds, a different species for each variety of
Heliconia. Over time, the lengths of the flowers and the form of the
hummingbirds' beaks have evolved to match each other. The length of
the Heliconia flower is therefore an important measurement. Does it
have a normal distribution for each variety?

The data set at
[http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/heliconia.csv](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/heliconia.csv) contains
the lengths (in millimetres) of samples of flowers from each of three
varieties of Heliconia: *bihai*, *caribaea* red, and
*caribaea* yellow.



(a) Read the data into R. There are different numbers of length
measurements for each variety. How does this show up in the data
frame? (Look at all the rows, not just the first ten.)



(b) Make a normal quantile plot for the variety
*bihai*. 



(c) Make a normal quantile plot for the variety
*Caribaea* red (note that the variable name in the data
frame has an underscore in it).



(d) Make a normal quantile plot for the variety
*Caribaea* yellow (this also has an underscore in it).



(e) Which of the three varieties is closest to having a normal
distribution? Explain (very) briefly.



(f) For each of the two other varieties, apart from the one you
mentioned in the last part, describe briefly how their distributions fail
to be normal.
