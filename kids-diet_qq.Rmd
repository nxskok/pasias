##  Diet and growth in boys


 A dietician is studying the effect of
different diets on children's growth. In part of the study, the
dietician is investigating two religious sects, labelled `a`
and `b` in our data set. Both sects are vegetarian; the
difference between them is that people in Sect A only eat vegetables
from below the ground, and Sect B only eats vegetables from above the
ground. The height and weight of the boys
`r tufte::margin_note("This was not sexism, but a recognition that boys and girls will be of different heights for reasons unrelated to diet. Doing it this way makes the analysis simpler.")` are measured at regular
intervals. The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/kids-diet.txt) are the
heights of the boys at age 12.



(a) Read in the data and find out how many observations you have
and which variables.



(b) Obtain side-by-side boxplots of the heights for boys from
each sect. Does it look as if the heights of the boys in each sect
are different? Comment briefly. 



(c) Looking at your boxplots, do you see any problems with
doing a two-sample $t$-test? Explain briefly.



(d) Run a $t$-test to determine whether the mean heights differ
significantly. What do you conclude? Explain briefly. (Run the
$t$-test even if your previous work suggests that it is not the
right thing to do.)
