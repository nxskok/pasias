##  Finding non-missing values


 <a name="part:prepare-next">*</a> This is to prepare you for something in the next
question. It's meant to be easy.

In R, the code `NA` stands for "missing value" or
"value not known". In R, `NA` should not have quotes around
it. (It is a special code, not a piece of text.)


(a) Create a vector `v` that contains some numbers and some
missing values, using `c()`. Put those values into a
one-column data frame.
 

(b) Obtain a new column containing `is.na(v)`. When is this true and when is this false?
 

(c) The symbol `!` means "not" in R (and other
programming languages). What does `!is.na(v)` do? Create a
new column containing that.
 

(d) Use `filter` to display just the
rows of your data frame that have a non-missing value of `v`.
