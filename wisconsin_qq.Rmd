##  Making a map of Wisconsin


 The file
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/wisconsin.txt) contains
the road distances (in miles) between 12 cities in Wisconsin and
neighbouring states. We are going to try to reproduce a map of the
area using multidimensional scaling.


(a) Read in the data and create a `dist` object,
bearing in mind that the data in the file are already
distances. Display your `dist` object. Probably, displaying
the data that you read in is a good idea also.
 

(b) Obtain a vector containing the city names. (This is easy,
and not really necessary, but it was here before when I did things
a different way.)
 

(c) Run a (metric) multidimensional scaling on the data, to
obtain a two-dimensional representation of the cities. (You
don't need to look at the results yet.)
 

(d) Plot the results of the multidimensional scaling,
labelling the cities with their names. Use your judgement to
decide where to place the city names, and how to  make sure the
whole city names are shown on the map.
 

(e) Are cities close together on your map also close together
in real life? Give an example or two.
 

(f) Obtain a Google (or other) map of the area containing these
twelve cities. (The way I expected you to do this when this was a
hand-in problem was to take a screenshot or similar and include that
in your document.)

 

(g) Discuss how the map that came out of the multidimensional
scaling corresponds to the actual (Google) map.

 

(h) Calculate something that demonstrates that a one-dimensional
map of the cities is a much worse representation than the
two-dimensional one that we made before. (I'm planning to get to this
in class, but if we skip it, don't worry about this part.)
