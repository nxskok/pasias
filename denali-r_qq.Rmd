##  Wolves and caribou


 In Denali National Park, Alaska, the size of the wolf
population depends on the size of the caribou population (since
wolves hunt and kill caribou). This is a large national park, so
caribou are found in very large herds, so big, in fact, that the
well-being of the entire herd is not threatened by wolf
attacks.^[In fact, it is believed that wolves help keep caribou herds strong by preventing over-population: that is, the weakest caribou are the ones taken by wolves.] 
Can the size of the caribou population
be used to predict the size of the wolf population?
The data can be found at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caribou.txt). The
columns 
are: the date of the survey,^[The survey is always taken in    the fall, but the date varies.] 
the name of the park employee in charge  of the survey, the caribou population (in hundreds) and the wolf  population (actual count).^[Counting animals in a region,    especially rare, hard-to-find animals, is a whole science in    itself. Our data are probably themselves estimates (with some    uncertainty).] 


(a) Take a look at the data file. How would you describe its
format? Read it into R, and check that you got something sensible.



(b) Create a new data frame where the column labelled
`date` is now a genuine R `Date`, using something
from `lubridate`.


(c) Create new columns containing the days of
the week and the month names for the dates.



(d) Enough playing around with dates. Make a scatterplot of
caribou population (explanatory) against wolf population
(response). Do you see any relationship?



(e) On your plot from the previous part, label each point with
the year it belongs to. You can do this in two steps: first make a
new column containing just the years, and then use it as labels
for the points on the plot.


(f) Make a plot of caribou population against time (this is done
the obvious way). What seems to be happening to the caribou
population over time?



(g) The caribou and wolf populations over time are 
really "time series". 
See if you can make a plot of *both* the
caribou and wolf populations against time. You can make two
$y$-axes, one for caribou and one for wolf; this will probably
require some research on your part to figure out.
