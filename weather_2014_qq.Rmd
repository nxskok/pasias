##  The weather, somewhere


 The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/weather_2014.csv) is of the
weather in a certain location: daily weather records for 2014. The
variables are:



* day of the year (1 through 365)

* day of the month

* number of the month

* season

* low temperature (for the day)

* high temperature

* average temperature

* time of the low temperature

* time of the high temperature

* rainfall (mm)

* average wind speed

* wind gust (highest wind speed)

* time of the wind gust

* wind direction




(a) Read in the data, and create a data frame containing only
the temperature variables, the rainfall and the wind speed variables
(the ones that are actual numbers, not times or text). Display the
first few lines of your data frame.
 

(b) Find five-number summaries for each column by running
`quantile` on all the columns of the data frame (at once, if
you can).
 

(c) Run a principal components analysis (on the correlation matrix).
 

(d) Obtain a `summary` of your principal components
analysis. How many components do you think are worth investigating?
 

(e) Make a scree plot. Does this
support your conclusion from the previous part?
 

(f) Obtain the component loadings. How do the first three
components depend on the original variables? (That is, what kind of
values for the original variables would make the component scores
large or small?)
 

(g) Obtain the principal component scores, for as many components
as you think are reasonable, and display the first
20 of them for each component alongside the other variables in your
data frame.
 

(h) Find a day that scores low on component 1, and explain briefly why
it came out that way (by looking at the measured variables).
 

(i) Find a day that scores high on component 2, and explain
briefly why it came out that way.
 

(j) Find a day that scores high on component 3, and explain
briefly why it came out high.
 

(k) Make a biplot of these data, labelling the days by the day
count (from 1 to 365). You may have to get the day count from the
original data frame that you read in from the file. You can shrink
the day numbers to make them overwrite each other (a bit) less.
 

(l) Looking at your biplot, what do you think was remarkable
about the weather on day 37? Day 211? Confirm your guesses by
looking at the appropriate rows of your data frame (and comparing
with your `summary` from earlier).
