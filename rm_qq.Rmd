##  Repeated measures with no background


 Nine people are randomly chosen to receive one of three
treatments, labelled A, B and C. Each person has their response
`y` to the treatment measured at three times, labelled T1, T2
and T3. The main aim of the study is to properly assess the effects of
the treatments. A higher value of `y` is better.

The data are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/rm.txt).



(a) There are $9 \times 3=27$ observations  of `y` in
this study. Why would it be wrong to treat these as 27 independent
observations? Explain briefly.


(b) Read in the data values. Are they tidy or untidy?  Explain
briefly. (The data values are separated by *tabs*, like the
Australian athlete data.)


(c) Make a spaghetti plot: that is, a plot of `y`
against time, with the observations for the same individual joined
by lines which are coloured according to the treatment that
individual received.


(d) On your spaghetti plot, how do the values of `y` for
the treatments compare over time?


(e) Explain briefly how the data are in the wrong format for a
repeated-measures ANOVA (done using MANOVA, as in class), and use
`pivot_wider` to get the data set into the right format.


(f) Run a repeated-measures ANOVA the `Manova` way. What do you
conclude from it?


(g) How is your conclusion from the previous part consistent
with your spaghetti plot? Explain briefly.
