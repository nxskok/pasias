##  How do you like your steak?


 When you order a steak in a restaurant, the server will ask
you how you would like it cooked, or to be precise, *how much*
you would like it cooked: rare (hardly cooked at all), through medium
rare, medium, medium well to well (which means "well done", so that
the meat has only a little red to it). Could you guess how a person
likes their steak cooked, from some other information about them? The
website [link](fivethirtyeight.com) commissioned a survey where they
asked a number of people how they preferred their steak, along with as
many other things as they could think of to ask. (Many of the
variables below are related to risk-taking, which was something the
people designing the survey thought might have something to do with
liking steak rare.) The variables of interest are all factors or true/false:



* `respondent_ID`: a ten-digit number identifying each
person who responded to the survey.

* `lottery_a`: true if the respondent preferred lottery A
with a small chance to win a lot of money, to lottery B, with a
larger chance to win less money.

* `smoke`: true if the respondent is currently a smoker

* `alcohol`: true if the respondent at least occasionally
drinks alcohol.

* `gamble`: true if the respondent likes to gamble (eg.
betting on horse racing or playing the lottery)

* `skydiving`: true if the respondent has ever been
skydiving.

* `speed`: true if the respondent likes to drive fast

* `cheated`: true if the respondent has ever cheated on a
spouse or girlfriend/boyfriend

* `steak`: true if the respondent likes to eat steak

* `steak_prep` (response): how the respondent likes their
steak cooked (factor, as described above, with 5 levels).

* `female`: true if the respondent is female

* `age`: age group, from 18--29 to 60+.

* `hhold_income`: household income group, from \$0--24,999
to \$150,000+.

* `educ`: highest level of education attained, from 
"less than high school" up to "graduate degree"

* `region`: region (of the US)
that the respondent lives in (five values).


The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/steak1.csv). This is the
cleaned-up data from a previous question, with the missing values removed.



(a) Read in the data and display the first few lines.




(b) We are going to predict `steak_prep` from some of
the other variables. Why is the model-fitting function `polr`
from package `MASS` the best choice for these data
(alternatives being `glm` and `multinom` from package
`nnet`)?



(c) What are the levels of `steak_prep`, 
*in the  order that R thinks they are in?* If they are not in a sensible
order, create an ordered factor where the levels are in a sensible order.



(d) Fit a model predicting preferred steak preparation in an
ordinal logistic regression from `educ`, `female` and
`lottery_a`. This ought to be easy from your previous work,
but you have to be careful about one thing. No need to print out the
results. 



(e) Run `drop1` on your fitted model, with
`test="Chisq"`. Which explanatory variable should be removed
first, if any? Bear in mind that the variable with the
*smallest* AIC should come out first, in case your table
doesn't get printed in order.



(f) Remove the variable that should come out first, using
`update`. (If all the variables should stay, you can skip
this part.)



(g) Using the best model that you have so far, predict the
probabilities of preferring each different steak preparation (method
of cooking) for each combination of the variables that
remain. (Some of the variables are TRUE and FALSE rather than
factors. Bear this in mind.)
Describe the effects of each variable on the predicted
probabilities, if any. Note that there is exactly one person in the
study whose educational level is "less than high school".



(h) Is it reasonable to remove *all* the remaining
explanatory variables from your best model so far? Fit a model with no explanatory variables,
and do a test. (In R, if the right side of the squiggle is a
`1`, that means "just an intercept". Or you can remove
whatever remains using `update`.) What do you conclude?
Explain briefly.



(i) In the article for which these data were collected,
[link](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/how-americans-like-their-steak/),
does the author obtain consistent conclusions with yours? Explain
briefly. (It's not a very long article, so it won't take you long to
skim through, and the author's point is pretty clear.)
