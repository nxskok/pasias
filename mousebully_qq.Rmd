##  Exercise and anxiety and bullying mice


 Does exercise help to reduce anxiety?
To assess this, some researchers randomly assigned
mice to either 
an enriched environment where there was an exercise wheel available,
or a standard environment with no exercise options. After three weeks
in the specified environment, for five minutes a day for two weeks,
the mice were each exposed to a "mouse bully" --- a mouse who was very
strong, aggressive, and territorial. One measure of mouse anxiety is
amount of time hiding in a dark compartment, with mice who are more
anxious spending more time in darkness. The amount of time spent in
darkness is recorded for each of the mice. 

The data can be found at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/stressedmice.txt). 



(a) Read the data into R, and display your data frame. Count the number of mice in each group. 


(b) Draw side-by-side boxplots of time spent in darkness for each
group of mice.


(c) Do the boxplots support the hypothesis about exercise and
anxiety? Explain briefly.


(d) Carry out a $t$-test for comparing the mean time spent in
darkness for the mice in the two groups. Think carefully about the
details of the $t$-test (and what you need evidence in favour of).


(e) What do you conclude, in terms of anxiety and exercise (at
least for mice)? Explain  briefly.


(f) Does anything in the previous parts suggest any problems with
the analysis you just did? Explain briefly.
