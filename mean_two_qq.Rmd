## Designing a study to have enough power

 You are designing a study to test the null hypothesis that a population mean is 0 against the alternative hypothesis that it is greater than 0. Assume that the population SD is $\sigma=15$. It is important to detect the alternative $\mu=2$; that is, we want to design the study so that most of the time the null hypothesis would be (correctly) rejected if in fact $\mu=2$. A one-sample $t$-test will be used, and the data values are assumed to have a normal distribution.



(a) Use simulation to estimate the power of this test when the sample size is 100. Use $\alpha=0.05$.



(b) Again by using simulation, estimate how large a sample size would be needed to obtain a power of 0.80. Show and briefly explain your process.
