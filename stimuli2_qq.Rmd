##  Feeling similar, again


 Previously, we looked at an experiment about which objects feel similar to one another and which ones feel different.

30 subjects were each
given 17 different objects to feel, for example 
"inner surface of pine  bark", 
"rubber eraser" and 
"nylon scouring pad". The
subjects had to group the objects into a maximum of 8 groups such that
the objects within a group felt similar, and the ones in different
groups felt different.
A
dissimilarity matrix was formed by counting how many subjects put each
pair of objects into *different* groups, so that the
dissimilarity ranged from 0 (the objects were always put together in
the same group) to 30 (the objects were not put together into the same
group by any of the subjects). 

The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/stimuli.txt). These have
*no* column names.

This time we are going to try *non-metric* multidimensional
scaling, to see whether that produces a more reasonable map. The
reading in of the data is the same as before (so I have reduced the
marks given for it).



(a) Obtain and display the distance matrix that you used last
time for these data. (I don't care whether you run all the code
again, or whether you just produce the matrix from where you had it
before on R Studio. Correct is all I care about.)



(b) Obtain a non-metric multidimensional scaling map of the
objects. (No plotting or comments yet.)



(c) <a name="part:stress">*</a> Obtain a number that says how well the map reproduces the
distances in the data, and comment on that number.



(d) Plot the non-metric multidimensional scaling map. Label each
point with its (full) object name, sized suitably.



(e) <a name="part:incons">*</a> Find all the distances in your distance matrix that are 10
or less (there should be three of them). Find these pairs of objects
on your map. Describe where they are on your map. Do
they appear to be the three closest pairs of objects?



(f) Consider again your conclusions in parts (<a href="#part:stress">here</a>)
and (<a href="#part:incons">here</a>). Explain briefly how they are consistent.



(g) Would a three-dimensional map work better than a
two-dimensional one, bearing in mind that a three-dimensional map
will need something like `rgl` to interpret? Calculate
something that will help you decide, and explain what you think.
