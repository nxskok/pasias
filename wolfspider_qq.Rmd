##  Finding wolf spiders on the beach


 <a name="q:wolfspider">*</a> 
A team of Japanese researchers were investigating what would
cause the burrowing wolf spider *Lycosa ishikariana* to be found
on a beach. They hypothesized that it had to do with the size of the
grains of sand on the beach. They went to 28 beaches in Japan,
measured the average sand grain size (in millimetres), and observed
the presence or absence of this particular spider on each beach. The
data are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/spiders.txt). 



(a) Why would logistic regression be better than regular
regression in this case?
 

(b) Read in the data and check that you have something
sensible. (Look at the data file first: the columns are aligned but
the headers are not aligned with them.)
 

(c) Make a boxplot of sand grain size according to whether the
spider is present or absent. Does this suggest that sand grain size
has something to do with presence or absence of the spider?
 

(d) Fit a logistic regression predicting the presence or
absence of spiders from the grain size, and obtain its
`summary`. Note that you will need to do something with the
response variable first.
 

(e) Is there a significant relationship between grain size and
presence or absence of spiders at the $\alpha=0.10$ level? Explain briefly.
 

(f) Obtain predicted probabilities of spider presence
for a representative collection of grain sizes.
I only want predicted probabilities, not
any kind of intervals.
 

(g) Given your previous work in this question, does the trend
you see in your predicted probabilities surprise you? Explain briefly.
