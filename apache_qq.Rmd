##  Who needs the most intensive care?


 The "APACHE II" is a scale for assessing patients who
arrive in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital. These are seriously
ill patients who may die despite the ICU's best attempts. APACHE
stands for "Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation".^[As with many of these acronyms, you get the idea that the acronym came first and they devised some words to fit it.]
The scale score is calculated from several physiological measurements
such as body temperature, heart rate and the Glasgow coma scale, as
well as the patient's age. The final result is a score between 0 and
71, with a higher score indicating more severe health issues. Is it
true that a patient with a higher APACHE II score has a higher
probability of dying?

Data from one hospital are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/apache.txt). The columns
are: the APACHE II score, the total number of patients who had that
score, and the number of patients with that score who died.



(a) Read in and display the data (however much of it
displays). Why are you convinced that have the right thing?


(b) Does each row of the data frame relate to one patient or
sometimes to more than one? Explain briefly.


(c) Explain why this is the kind of situation where you need a
two-column response, and create this response variable, bearing in
mind that I will (later) want you to estimate the probability of
dying, given the `apache` score.


(d) Fit a logistic regression to estimate the probability of
death from the `apache` score, and display the results.


(e) Is there a significant effect of `apache` score on the
probability of survival? Explain briefly.


(f) Is the effect of a larger `apache` score to increase or to
decrease the probability of death? Explain briefly.


(g) Obtain the predicted probability of death for each of the
`apache` scores that were in the data set. Display these predicted
probabilities next to the `apache` values that they came
from. (You can display all of them.)


(h) Make a plot of predicted death probability against
`apache` score (joined by lines) with, also on the plot, the
observed proportion of deaths within each `apache` score,
plotted against `apache` score. Does there seem to be good
agreement between observation and prediction?
