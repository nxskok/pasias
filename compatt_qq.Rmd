##  Computerized accounting


 Beginning accounting students need to
learn to learn to audit in a computerized environment. A sample of
beginning accounting students took each of two tests: the Computer
Attitude Scale (CAS) and the Computer Anxiety Rating Scale (CARS). A
higher score in each indicates greater anxiety around computers. The test scores are scaled to be between 0 and 5. Also
noted was each student's gender. The data are in
[http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/compatt.txt](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/compatt.txt). The data values are separated by spaces.



(a) Read the data into R. Do you have what you expected? Explain briefly. 



(b) How many males and females were there in the sample?



(c) Do the CAS scores tend to be higher for females or for males? Draw a suitable graph to help you decide, and come to a conclusion.



(d) Find the median CAS scores for each gender. Does this support what you saw on your plot? Explain briefly.



(e) Find the mean and standard deviation of both CAS and CARS scores (for all the students combined, ie.\ not separated by gender) *without* naming those columns explicitly.
