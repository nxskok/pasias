##  Length of gestation in North Carolina


 The data in file
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ncbirths.csv) are about
500 randomly chosen births of babies in North Carolina. There is a lot
of information: not just the weight at birth of the baby, but whether
the baby was born prematurely, the ages of the parents, whether the
parents are married, how long (in weeks) the pregnancy lasted (this is
called the "gestation") and so on. We have seen these data before.



(a) Read in the data from the file into R, bearing in mind what
type of file it is. 



(b) Find a 95\% confidence interval for the mean birth weight of
all babies born in North Carolina (of which these babies are a
sample). At the end, you should state what the confidence interval is.
Giving some output is necessary, but *not* enough by itself.

If your variable name has a space or other special character (like a
question mark) in it, remember that you have to surround its name with
backticks, as discussed the first time we looked at these data.




(c) Birth weights of babies born in the United States have a mean
of 7.3 pounds. Is there any evidence that babies born in North
Carolina are less heavy on average? State appropriate hypotheses, do your
test, obtain a P-value and state your conclusion, in terms of the
original data.




(d) The theory behind the $t$-test says that the distribution of
birth weights should be (approximately) normally distributed. Obtain a
histogram of the birth weights. Does it look approximately normal?
Comment briefly. (You'll have to pick a number of bins for your
histogram first. I don't mind very much what you pick, as long as it's
not obviously too many or too few bins.)
