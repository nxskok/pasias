##  Orange juice


We will read in the orange juice data again,
in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ojuice.txt), and make a suitable graph.


(a) The data values are separated by a space. Use the appropriate
Tidyverse function to read the data directly from the course website
into a "tibble".



(b) The juice manufacturer was interested in whether there was a
relationship between sweetness and pectin. To assess this, draw a
scatterplot.  Does it look as if there is any kind of a
relationship? (I think `sweetness` is the outcome variable
and `pectin` is explanatory, so draw your scatterplot
appropriately.)
