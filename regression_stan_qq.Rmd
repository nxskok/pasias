##  Bayesian regression


 In this question, we will develop Stan code to run a simple
linear regression, and later apply it to some data (and do a bit of
elicitation of prior distributions along the way).



(a) Create a `.stan` file that will run a simple linear
regression predicting a variable `y` from a variable
`x`, estimating an intercept `a` and a slope
`b`. Use normal prior distributions for `a` and
`b`, and allow the means and SDs of the prior distributions
for `a` and `b` to be specified (as data, later). The
regression model says that the response `y` has a normal
distribution with mean `a+bx` and SD `sigma` which is
also estimated. Give this a prior chi-squared distribution with a
prior mean that is also input.


(b) Check your Stan code for syntactic correctness, and when it is
correct, compile it.


(c) We are going to be analyzing some data on vocabulary size (the number of words known) by children of different ages. It is suspected that the relationship between age and vocabulary size is approximately linear.
You go consult with an early childhood expert, and they tell you this:


* In children of age up to about six, vocabulary almost always
increases by between 300 and 700 words per year.

* I can't talk about vocabulary of children of age 0, because children don't start learning to talk until age about 18 months (1.5 years).

* Children of age 1.5 years almost always have a vocabulary
between 0 and 500 words (depending on exactly what age they
started talking.)

* Even if we know a child's age, our prediction of their
vocabulary size might be off by as much as 200 words.

Use this information to obtain parameters for your prior distributions.


(d) Some data were collected on age and vocabulary size of 10
randomly selected children, shown here:
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/pasias/master/vocab.txt). Read
in and display the data; the values are separated by single spaces.


(e) Use this dataset, along with your prior distribution from
above, to obtain posterior distributions for intercept, slope and
error SD. What is the 95\% posterior interval for the slope?


(f) Plot a histogram of the posterior distribution of the slope. Does its shape surprise you? Explain briefly.



(g) What can we say about the vocabulary size of a randomly
selected child of age 5 (a new one, not the one in the original data
set)? Use an appropriate predictive distribution.
