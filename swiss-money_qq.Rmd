##  Telling whether a banknote is real or counterfeit


 <a name="sec:swiss-money">*</a> A Swiss bank collected  a number of known counterfeit
(fake) 
bills over time, and sampled a number of known genuine bills of the
same denomination.
Is it possible to tell, from measurements taken from a bill, whether
it is genuine or not? We will explore that issue here. The variables
measured were:


* length

* right-hand width

* left-hand width

* top margin

* bottom margin

* diagonal



(a) Read in the data from
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/swiss1.txt), and
check that you have 200 rows and 7 columns altogether.
 

(b) Run a multivariate analysis of variance. What do you
conclude? Is it worth running a discriminant analysis? (This is
the same procedure as with basic MANOVAs before.) 
 

(c) Run a discriminant analysis. Display the output.
 


(d) How many linear 
discriminants did you get? Is that making sense? Explain briefly.
 

(e) <a name="part:big">*</a> 
Using your output from the discriminant analysis, describe how
each of the linear discriminants that you got is related to your
original variables. (This can, maybe even should, be done crudely:
"does each variable feature in each linear discriminant: yes or no?".)
 

(f) What values of your variable(s) would make `LD1`
large and positive?
 

(g) <a name="part:means">*</a> Find the means of each variable for each group (genuine
and counterfeit bills). You can get this from your fitted linear
discriminant object.
 

(h) Plot your linear discriminant(s), however you like. Bear in
mind that there is only one linear discriminant.
 

(i) What kind of score on `LD1` do genuine bills
typically have? What kind of score do counterfeit bills typically
have? What characteristics of a bill, therefore, would you look at
to determine if a bill is genuine or counterfeit?
