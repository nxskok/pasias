##  How not to get heart disease


 What is associated with heart disease? In a study, a large
number of variables were measured, as follows:



* `age` (years)

* `sex` male or female

* `pain.type` Chest pain type (4 values: typical angina,
atypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic)

* `resting.bp` Resting blood pressure, on admission to hospital

* `serum.chol` Serum cholesterol

* `high.blood.sugar`: greater than 120, yes or no

* `electro` resting electrocardiographic results (normal,
having ST-T, hypertrophy)

* `max.hr` Maximum heart rate

* `angina` Exercise induced angina (yes or no)

* `oldpeak` ST depression induced by exercise relative to
rest. See [link](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ecg-library/st-segment/).

* `slope` Slope of peak exercise ST segment. Sloping up,
flat or sloping down

* `colored` number of major vessels (0--3) coloured by fluoroscopy

* `thal` normal, fixed defect, reversible defect

* `heart.disease` 1=absent, 2=present


I don't know what most of those are, but we will not let that stand in
our way. Our aim is to find out what variables are associated with
heart disease, and what values of those variables give high
probabilities of heart disease being present. The data are in
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/heartf.csv).



(a) Read in the data. Display the first few lines and convince
yourself that those values are reasonable.


Solution

```{r heart-1, child="packages.Rmd", message = FALSE}
```


A `.csv` file, so:
```{r heart-2 }
my_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/heartf.csv"
heart <- read_csv(my_url)
heart
```

     

You should check that the variables that should be numbers actually
are, that the variables that should be categorical have (as far as is
shown) the right values as per my description above, and you should
make some comment in that direction.

My variables appear to be correct, apart possibly for that variable
`X1` which is actually just the row number.
    
$\blacksquare$

(b) In a logistic regression, what probability will be
predicted here? Explain briefly but convincingly. (Is each line of
the data file one observation or a summary of several?)


Solution


Each line of the data file is a single observation, not
frequencies of yes and no (like the premature babies
question, later, is). The response variable is a factor, so the first level
is the baseline and the *second* level is the one
predicted. R puts factor levels alphabetically, so `no` is
first and `yes` is second. That is, a logistic regression
will predict the probability that a person *does* have heart disease.
I want to see that logic (which is why I said "convincingly"):
one observation per line, and therefore that the second level of
the factor is predicted, which is `yes`. 
    
$\blacksquare$

(c) <a name="part:heart-first">*</a> Fit a logistic regression predicting heart disease from
everything else (if you have a column called `X` or
`X1`, ignore that), and display the results.


Solution


A lot of typing, since there are so many variables. Don't forget
that the response variable *must* be a factor:
```{r heart-3 }
heart.1 <- glm(factor(heart.disease) ~ age + sex + pain.type + resting.bp + serum.chol +
  high.blood.sugar + electro + max.hr + angina + oldpeak + slope + colored + thal,
family = "binomial", data = heart
)
```

 

You can split this over several lines (and probably should), but make
sure to end each line in such a way that there is unambiguously more
to come, for example with a plus or a comma (though probably the fact
that you have an unclosed bracket will be enough). 

The output is rather lengthy:

```{r heart-4 }
summary(heart.1)
```

 

I didn't ask you for further comment, but note that quite a lot of
these variables are factors, so you get slopes for things like
`pain.typeatypical`. When you have a factor in a model, there
is a slope for each level except for the first, which is a baseline
(and its slope is taken to be zero). That would be
`asymptomatic` for `pain.type`. The $t$-tests for the
other levels of `pain.type` say whether that level of pain
type differs significantly (in terms of probability of heart disease)
from the baseline level. Here, pain type `atypical` is not
significantly different from the baseline, but the other two pain
types, `nonanginal` and `typical`, *are*
significantly different. If you think about this from an ANOVA-like
point of view, the question about `pain.type`'s significance is
really "is there at least one of the pain types that is different from the others", and if we're thinking about whether we should keep
`pain.type` in the logistic regression, this is the kind of
question we should be thinking about. 
    
$\blacksquare$

(d) Quite a lot of our explanatory variables are factors. To
assess whether the factor as a whole should stay or can be removed,
looking at the slopes won't help us very much (since they tell us
whether the other levels of the factor differ from the baseline,
which may not be a sensible comparison to make). To assess which
variables are candidates to be removed, factors included (properly),
we can use `drop1`. Feed `drop1` a fitted model and
the words `test="Chisq"` (take care of the capitalization!)
and you'll get a list of P-values. Which variable is the one that
you would remove first? Explain briefly.


Solution


Following the instructions:

```{r heart-5 }
drop1(heart.1, test = "Chisq")
```

 

The highest P-value, 0.5525, goes with `high.blood.sugar`, so
this one comes out first. (The P-value for `age` is almost as
high, 0.5427, so you might guess that this will be next.)

You might be curious about how these compare with the P-values on
`summary`. These two P-values are almost the same as the ones
on `summary`, because they are a two-level factor and a numeric
variable respectively, and so the tests are equivalent in the two
cases. (The P-values are not identical because the tests on
`summary` and `drop1` are the kind of thing that would
be identical on a regular regression but are only "asymptotically the same" 
in logistic regression, so you'd expect them to be close
without being the same, as here. "Asymptotically the same" means
that if you had an infinitely large sample size, they'd be identical,
but our sample size of 200-odd individuals is not infinitely large!
Anyway, the largest P-value on the `summary` is 0.9965, which
goes with `electroSTT`. `electro`, though, is a factor
with three levels; this P-value says that `STT` is almost
identical (in its effects on heart disease) with the baseline
`hypertrophy`. But there is a third level, `normal`,
which is a bit different from `hypertrophy`. So the factor
`electro` overall has some effect on heart disease, which is
reflected in the `drop1` P-value of 0.12: this might go later,
but it has to stay for now because at least one of its levels is
different from the others in its effect on heart disease. (In backward
elimination, multi-level factors are removed in their entirety if
*none* of their levels have a different effect from any of the
others.) 

The power just went out here, so I am using my laptop on battery on
its own screen, rather than on the big screen I have in my office,
which is much better.

$\blacksquare$

(e) I'm not going to make you do the whole backward elimination
(I'm going to have you use `step` for that later), but do one
step: that is, fit a model removing the variable you think should be
removed, using `update`, and then run `drop1` again to
see which variable will be removed next.


Solution


`update` is the obvious choice here, since we're making a
small change to a *very* big model:
```{r heart-6 }
heart.2 <- update(heart.1, . ~ . - high.blood.sugar)
drop1(heart.2, test = "Chisq")
```

   

The power is back. 

The next variable to go is indeed `age`, with a P-value that
has hardly changed: it is now 0.5218.
    
$\blacksquare$

(f) Use `step` to do a backward elimination to find which
variables have an effect on heart disease. Display your final model
(which you can do by saving the output from `step` in a
variable, and asking for the summary of that. In `step`,
you'll need to specify a starting model (the one from part
(<a href="#part:heart-first">here</a>)), the direction of elimination, and the test
to base the elimination decision on (the same one as you used in
`drop1`). 


Solution


The hints ought to lead you to this:
```{r heart-7, size="tiny"}
heart.3 <- step(heart.1, direction = "backward", test = "Chisq")
```

       

The output is very long.
In terms of AIC, which is what `step` uses, `age`
hangs on for a bit, but eventually gets eliminated. 

There are a lot of variables left.
      
$\blacksquare$

(g) Display the summary of the model that came out of `step`.


Solution


This:

```{r heart-8 }
summary(heart.3)
```

 

Not all of the P-values in the `step` output wound up being
less than 0.05, but they are all at least reasonably small. As
discussed above, some of the P-values in the `summary` are
definitely *not* small, but they go with factors where there are
significant effects *somewhere*. For example, `thalnormal`
is not significant (that is, `normal` is not significantly
different from the baseline `fixed`), but the other level
`reversible` *is* different from `fixed`. You might
be wondering about `slope`: on the `summary` there is
nothing close to significance, but on the `step` output,
`slope` has at least a reasonably small P-value of 0.088. This
is because the significant difference does not involve the baseline:
it's actually between `flat` with a positive slope and
`upsloping` with a negative one. 
  
$\blacksquare$

(h) We are going to make a large number of predictions. Create
a data frame that contains all combinations of representative
values for all the variables in the model that came out of
`step`. By "representative" I mean all the values for a
categorical variable, and the first and third quartiles for a numeric
variable.


Solution


Let's take a breath first.
There are two pieces of stuff to do here: we need to get the
quartiles of the quantitative variables, and we need all the
different values of the categorical ones. There are several of
each, so we want some kind of automated method.
The easy way of getting the quartiles is via `summary`
of the whole data frame:
```{r heart-9 }
summary(heart)
```

         
This is the old-fashioned "base R" way of doing it. The
`tidyverse` way is to get the Q1 and Q3 of just the variables
that are numeric. We are doing something to (summarizing) these variables, so we need the `across(where())` idea to get just the numeric ones. We also need a `list` at the end because we are computing two summaries for each variable, Q1 and Q3, rather than just one. Finally, something that's easy to mess up (I do it all the time) is the closing bracket of the `across`: this goes *right at the end*, because the calculation is inside the `across` as well:

```{r heart-10 }
heart %>% summarize(across(where(is.numeric), 
                           list(q1 = ~quantile(., 0.25),
                                q3 = ~quantile(., 0.75))))
```

These are the Q1 and Q3 for each variable in turn; we already had quite a lot of variables, and now we have twice as many columns as we had before.  Click the right-arrow to see everything. 

One way to see all the results is
to "transpose" the result with the variable-quartile combinations in
a column and the actual quartile values in another:

```{r heart-11 }
heart %>% summarize(across(where(is.numeric), 
                           list(q1 = ~quantile(., 0.25),
                                q3 = ~quantile(., 0.75)))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to="vq", values_to="quartile") -> heart2
heart2
```

 

If you want to be really fancy:

```{r heart-12 }
heart %>% summarize(across(where(is.numeric), 
                           list(q1 = ~quantile(., 0.25),
                                q3 = ~quantile(., 0.75)))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to=c("variable", "which_quartile"), 
               names_sep="_", values_to="quartile") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=which_quartile, values_from=quartile)
```

You would *definitely* benefit from running this pipeline one line at a time to see how it works! The `summarize` produces columns with names like `age_q1`, which are then split up into a variable name and a "which quartile" by the fancy version of `pivot_longer`. (If you prefer, this is the vanilla version of `pivot_longer` followed by `separate`. For yourself, do it the way that makes sense to you.) Finally, I put Q1 and Q3 in their own columns so that you can see them side by side.
 

The categorical variables are a bit trickier, because they will have
different numbers of possible values. Here's my idea:

```{r zimbru}
heart %>%
  select(where(is.character)) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~factor(.))) %>%
  summary()
```

 

My thought was that if you pass a genuine factor into `summary`
(as opposed to a categorical variable that is text), it displays all
its "levels" (different categories). So, to get to that point, I had
to select all the categorical-as-text variables (which is actually all
the ones that are not numeric), and then make a factor out of each of
them. `mutate` with `across(everything())` does the same thing to all the columns: "for
each column, run `factor` on it", and saves the results back in variables
of the same name as they were before. Using `summary` also
shows how many observations we had in each category.

What I would really like to do is to save these category names
somewhere so I don't have to type them below when I make all possible
combinations. My go at that:

```{r heart-13 }
heart %>%
  select(where(is.character)) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to="variable_name", values_to="value") %>%
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(variable_name, value) -> heart3
heart3
```

 

Gosh, that was easier than I thought. A *lot* easier. The
technique is a lot like that idea for making facetted plots of
something against "all the $x$s": you collect everything up into one
column containing a variable name and another column containing the
variable value. This contains a lot of repeats; the `distinct`
keeps one of each and throws away the rest.

Hmm, another way would be to count everything:

```{r heart-14 }
heart %>%
  select(where(is.character)) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to="variable_name", values_to="value") %>%
  count(variable_name, value) -> heart3
heart3 
```

 

That perhaps is more obvious in retrospect, because there are no new
tools there.

Now, we come to setting up the variables that we are going to make all
combinations of. For a quantitative variable such as `age`, I
need to go back to `heart2`:

```{r heart-15 }
heart2
```

 

and pull out the rows whose names contain `age_`. This is done
using `str_detect`^[If you're selecting *columns*,  you can use select-helpers, but for rows, not.] from
`stringr`.^[Which is loaded with the `tidyverse`  so you don't have to load it.] 
Here's how it goes for `age`:

```{r heart-16 }
heart2 %>%
  filter(str_detect(vq, "age_"))
```

 

and one more step to get just the quartiles:

```{r heart-17 }
heart2 %>%
  filter(str_detect(vq, "age_")) %>%
  pull(quartile)
```

 

We'll be doing this a few times, so we should write a function to do it:

```{r heart-18 }
get_quartiles <- function(d, x) {
  d %>%
    filter(str_detect(vq, x)) %>%
    pull(quartile)
}
```



and to test:

```{r heart-19 }
get_quartiles(heart2, "age_")
```

 

Yep. I put the underscore in so as to not catch other variables that
have `age` inside them but not at the end.

For the categorical variables, we need to look in `heart3`:

```{r heart-20 }
heart3
```

 

then choose the rows with the right thing in `variable_name`, and then
pull just the `value` column. This is sufficiently like the
previous one that I think we can write a function right away:

```{r heart-21 }
get_categories <- function(d, x) {
  d %>%
    filter(variable_name == x) %>%
    pull(value)
}
get_categories(heart3, "electro")
```

 
All right, setup, using my usual habit of plural names, and using
those functions we just wrote: 

```{r heart-22 }
sexes <- get_categories(heart3, "sex")
pain.types <- get_categories(heart3, "pain.type")
resting.bps <- get_quartiles(heart2, "resting.bp_")
serum.chols <- get_quartiles(heart2, "serum.chol_")
max.hrs <- get_quartiles(heart2, "max.hr_")
oldpeaks <- get_quartiles(heart2, "oldpeak_")
slopes <- get_categories(heart3, "slope")
coloreds <- get_quartiles(heart2, "colored_")
thals <- get_categories(heart3, "thal")
```

 

All combos of all of those (and there will be a lot of those):

```{r heart-23 }
heart.new <- crossing(
  sex = sexes, pain.type = pain.types, resting.bp = resting.bps,
  serum.chol = serum.chols, max.hr = max.hrs, oldpeak = oldpeaks, slope = slopes,
  colored = coloreds, thal = thals
)
heart.new
```

 

Yeah, that's a lot. Fortunately, we won't have to look at them all.
        
$\blacksquare$

(i) Obtain the predicted probabilities of heart disease for
the data frame you constructed in the last part, using your
model that came out of `step`. Add these predictions to
the data frame from the previous part (as a column in that data
frame). 


Solution


Get the predictions, which is less scary than it seems:
```{r heart-24 }
p <- predict(heart.3, heart.new, type = "response")
```

         

and the easiest way to add these to `heart.new` is this:

```{r heart-25 }
heart.new %>% mutate(pred = p) -> heart.new
```

 

Let's take a look at a few of the predictions, by way of sanity-checking:

```{r heart-26 }
heart.new %>% sample_n(8)
```

 

This seems at least reasonably sane.
        
$\blacksquare$

(j) Find the largest predicted probability (which is the
predicted probability of heart disease) and display all the
variables that it was a prediction for. 


Solution


This can be done in one step:
```{r heart-27 }
heart.new %>% filter(pred == max(pred))
```

         

or if you didn't think of that, you can find the maximum first, and
then display the rows with predictions close to it:

```{r heart-28 }
heart.new %>% summarize(m = max(pred))
heart.new %>% filter(pred > 0.98)
```

 

or even find *which* row has the maximum, and then display that row:

```{r heart-29 }
heart.new %>% summarize(row = which.max(pred))
heart.new %>% slice(1398)
```

 

or sort the rows by `pred`, descending, and display the top few:

```{r heart-30 }
heart.new %>% arrange(desc(pred)) %>% slice(1:8)
```

 
        
$\blacksquare$

(k) Compare the `summary` of the final model from
`step` with your highest predicted heart disease
probability and the values of the other variables that make it
up. Are they consistent?


Solution


Since we were predicting the probability of heart disease, a
more positive slope in the model from `step` will be
associated with a higher probability of heart disease. So,
there, we are looking for a couple of things: if the variable
is a factor, we're looking for the level with the most
positive slope (bearing in mind that this might be the
baseline), and for a numeric variable, if the slope is
positive, a *high* value is associated with heart
disease, and if negative, a low value.
Bearing that in mind, we go back to my
`summary(heart.3)` and we have:


* `sex`: being male has the higher risk, by a lot

* `pain`: all the slopes shown are negative, so the
highest risk goes with the baseline one
`asymptomatic`.

* `resting.bp`: positive slope, so higher risk with
higher value.

* `serum.chol`: same.

* `max.hr`: negative slope, so greatest risk with
*smaller* value.

* `oldpeak`: positive slope, greater risk with
higher value again.

* `slope`: `flat` has greatest risk.

* `colored`: positive slope, so beware of higher
value.

* `thal`: `reversible` has greatest risk.

Then we can do the same thing for the prediction. For the
numerical variables, we may need to check back to the previous
part to see whether the value shown was high or low. Once you
have done that, you can see that the variable values for the
highest predicted probability do indeed match the ones we
thought should be the highest risk.
The interesting thing about this is that after adjusting for
all of the other variables, there is a greater risk of heart
disease if you are male (and the model shows that the risk is
*much* greater). That is to say, it's being male that
makes the difference, not the fact that any of the other
variables are different for males.
Perhaps, therefore, the easiest way to avoid a heart attack is to not be male!
