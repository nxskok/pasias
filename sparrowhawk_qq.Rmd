##  Sparrowhawks

(This is a report-writing question, but it also uses some regression techniques from later in the course.)

 One of nature's patterns is the relationship
between the percentage of adult birds in a colony that return from the
previous year, and the number of new adults that join the colony. Data
for 13 colonies of sparrowhawks can be found at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/sparrowhawk.txt). The
columns are the percentage of adults returning from the previous year,
and the number of new adults that join the colony.



(a) Create a new R Markdown report, give it a suitable title, and
ask for HTML output. Answer the questions that follow in your
report. At any stage, you can Knit HTML
to see how the report looks so far.



(b) Read in the data and display the  first few values.  Add some text saying how many rows of data
there are.



(c) Create a new section entitled "Exploratory analysis", and
create a scatterplot for predicting number of new adults from the
percentage of returning adults.  Describe what you see, adding some
suitable text to your report.



(d) Obtain the correlation between the two variables. Is this
consistent with the scatterplot? Explain briefly. (The R function
you need is `cor`. You can feed it a data frame.)



(e) Obtain the regression line for predicting the number of new
adults from the percentage of returning adults.



(f) What are the intercept and slope of your regression line? Is
the slope significant? What does that mean, in the context of the data?



(g) Create a scatterplot of the data with the regression line on it.



(h) For short-lived birds, the association between these two
variables is positive: changes in weather and food supply cause the
populations of new and returning birds to increase together. For
long-lived territorial birds, however, the association is negative
because returning birds claim their territories in the colony and do
not leave room for new recruits. Which type of species is the
sparrowhawk? Add a short Conclusions section to your report with
discussion of this issue.
