##  Medical instructions


 Do people understand medical instructions better at certain
times of the day? In a study, students in a grade 12 class are
randomly divided into two groups, A and B. All students see a video
describing how to use an infant forehead thermometer. The students in
Group A see the video at 8:30 am, while the students in Group B see
the same video at 3:00 pm (on the same day). The next day, all the
students are given a test on the material in the video (graded out of
100). The observed scores are in

separated by spaces).



(a) Read the data into R and display the (first ten) values.



(b) Obtain a suitable plot that will enable you to assess the
assumptions for a two-sample $t$-test.



(c) Why might you have doubts about using a two-sample $t$-test here?



(d) Run Mood's median test as in class (*without* using
`smmr`). What do you conclude, in the context of the data?
What recommendation would you make about the time of day to see the
video?  (You might get a warning about "chisquared approximation  being incorrect", 
which you can ignore here.)



(e) Run Mood's median test on these data using my `smmr`
package, and verify that you get the same answer.
