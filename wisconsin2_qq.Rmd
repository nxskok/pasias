##  Making a map of Wisconsin


 The file
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/wisconsin.txt) contains
the road distances (in miles) between 12 cities in Wisconsin and
neighbouring states. We are going to try to draw a map of the
area using Leaflet.


(a) Read in the data, displaying
the data that you read in.




(b) Make a dataframe containing the names of the locations (get rid of the columns containing distances), and add a column of the abbreviations of the states they are in. All of them are in Wisconsin (WI), except for the
last three: Dubuque is in Iowa (IA), St.\ Paul is in Minnesota (MN) and Chicago
is in Illinois (IL).


(c) Create a new column in which the abbreviation for the state is glued on to the end of each `location`, separated by a space.


(d) Look up the latitudes and longitudes of these twelve places.


(e) Obtain a Leaflet map of the area containing these
twelve cities.
