##  What makes an animal get infected?


 Some animals got infected with a parasite. We are interested
in whether the likelihood of infection depends on any of the age,
weight and sex of the animals. The data are at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/infection.txt). The
values are separated by tabs.



(a) Read in the data and take a look at the first few lines. Is
this one animal per line, or are several animals with the same age,
weight and sex (and infection status) combined onto one line? How
can you tell?
 

(b) <a name="part:plot">*</a> Make suitable plots or summaries of `infected` against
each of the other variables. (You'll have to think about
`sex`, um, you'll have to think about the `sex`
variable, because it too is categorical.) Anything sensible is OK
here. You might like to think back to what we did in
Question <a href="#q:wolfspider">here</a> for inspiration. (You can also
investigate `table`, which does cross-tabulations.)
 

(c) Which, if any, of your explanatory variables appear to be
related to `infected`? Explain briefly.
 

(d) Fit a logistic regression predicting `infected` from
the other three variables. Display the `summary`.
 

(e) <a name="part:remove">*</a> Which variables, if any, would you consider removing from
the model? Explain briefly.
 

(f) Are the conclusions you drew in (<a href="#part:plot">here</a>) and
(<a href="#part:remove">here</a>) consistent, or not? Explain briefly.
 

(g) <a name="part:crossing">*</a>
The first and third quartiles of `age` are 26 and 130;
the first and third quartiles of `weight` are 9 and 16. Obtain predicted probabilities for all combinations of these and
`sex`. (You'll need to start by making a new data frame, using
`crossing` to get all the combinations.)
