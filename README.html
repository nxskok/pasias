<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/">This book</a> will hold a collection
of problems, and my solutions to them, in applied statistics with
R. These come from my courses STAC32, STAC33 and STAD29 at the University of
Toronto Scarborough.</p>
<p>The problems were originally written in Sweave (that is, LaTeX with R
code chunks), using the <code>exam</code> document class, using data sets stolen
from numerous places (textbooks, websites etc). I wrote <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/pasias/master/convert.pl">a Perl
program</a>
to strip out the LaTeX and turn each problem into R Markdown for this
book. You will undoubtedly see bits of LaTeX still embedded in the
text. I am trying to update my program to catch them, but I am sure to
miss some.</p>
<p>I just figured out that you can convert LaTeX “label” and “ref” pairs
into HTML “a name” and “a href=‘#’”, which R Markdown can handle. I am
ludicrously pleased with myself. To that effect, you will occasionally
see question parts beginning with a *; this means that other question
parts refer back to this one. (One of my favourite question strategies
is to ask how two different approaches lead to the same answer, or
more generally to demonstrate that there are different ways to see the
same thing.)</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> How you can help</h2>
<p>If you see anything, <a href="https://github.com/nxskok/pasias/issues">file an
issue</a> on the Github page.
I will take pull
requests and will acknowledge all the people who catch things. Likely
problems include:</p>
<ul>
<li>some LaTeX construction that I didn’t catch (eg. block quotes)</li>
<li>disappeared footnotes (that will show up as an apparently missing sentence in the text)</li>
<li>references to “in class” or a lecture or a course by course number, which need to be eliminated (in favour of wording like “a previous course”)</li>
<li>references to other questions or question parts that are <em>wrong</em> (likely caused by <em>not</em> being “labels” or “refs” in the original LaTeX)</li>
<li>my contorted English that is difficult to understand.</li>
</ul>

<div id="background-for-these-problems" class="section level2" number="0.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> Background for these problems</h2>
<p>As I read through looking for problems like these, I realize that
there ought to be a textbook that reflects my way of doing
things. There isn’t one (yet), though there are lecture
notes. Reasonably recent versions of these are at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/">the STAC32 website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC33/">the STAC33 website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/STAD29/">the STAD29 website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A little background:</p>
<p>STAC32 is an introduction to R (and also SAS) as
applied to statistical methods that have (mostly) been learned in
previous courses, for example a
non-mathematical applied course like
<a href="https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/stab27h3">this</a>. The idea is
that students have already seen a little of regression and analysis of
variance (and the things that precede them), and need only an
introduction of how to run them in R.</p>
<p>STAC33 covers similar ground to STAC32. It is intended for students with a more mathematical background, and will
include some extra material beyond what is in STAC32 (eg., bootstrapping, Bayesian statistics with Stan).</p>
<p>STAD29 is an overview of a number of advanced statistical methods. I
start from regression and proceed to some regression-like methods
(logistic regression, survival analysis, log-linear frequency table
analysis), then I go a little further with analysis of variance and
proceed with MANOVA and repeated measures. I finish with a look at
classical multivariate methods such as discriminant analysis, cluster
analysis, principal components and factor analysis. I cover a number
of methods in no great depth; my aim is to convey an understanding of
what these methods are for, how to run them and how to interpret the
results. Statistics majors and specialists cannot take this course for
credit (they have separate courses covering this material with the
proper mathematical background). D29 is intended for students in other
disciplines who find themselves wanting to learn more statistics; we
have an <a href="https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/minor-program-applied-statistics-science">Applied Statistics Minor
program</a>
for which C32 and D29 are two of the last courses.</p>
