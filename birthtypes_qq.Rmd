##  Types of childbirth


 Childbirths can be of two types: a
"vaginal" birth in which the child is born through the mother's
 vagina in the normal fashion, and a "cesarean section" where a
 surgeon cuts through the wall of the mother's abdomen, and the baby
 is delivered through the incision. Cesarean births are used when
 there are difficulties in pregnancy or during childbirth that would
 make a vaginal birth too risky.
A hospital kept track of the number of vaginal and Cesarean births
 for the twelve months of 2012. Of interest is whether the Cesarean
 rate (the ratio of Cesarean births to all births) was increasing,
 decreasing or remaining stable over that time.
The data may be found at
 [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/birthtypes.txt). The
 columns are the names of the months (in 2012), the number of cesarean
 births and the number of vaginal births. (The data are not real, but
 are typical of the kind of thing you would observe.)


(a) Read the data into R and display your data frame.


(b) Create a column of actual dates and also a column of
cesarean rates, as defined above. Store your new data frame in a
variable and display it. For the dates, assume that each date is of
the 1st of the month that it belongs to.


(c) Plot the cesarean rate against time, with a smooth
trend. Do you see an upward trend, a downward trend, no trend, or
something else?


(d) Try to summarize the trend you just found with a
correlation. What goes wrong? How can you fix it?
