##  Atomic weight of carbon


 The atomic weight of the chemical element
carbon is 12. Two methods of measuring the atomic weight of samples of
carbon were compared. The results are shown in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/carbon.txt). The methods
are labelled 1 and 2.  The first task is to find out whether the two
methods have different "typical" measures (mean or median, as
appropriate) of the atomic weight of carbon.

For this question, compose a report in R Markdown.  (R Markdown is
what you use in an R Notebook, but you can also have a separate R
Markdown document from which you can produce HTML, Word etc. output.)
See part (a) for how to get this started.

Your report should
read like an actual report, not just the answers to some questions
that I set you. To help with that, write some text that links the
parts of the report together smoothly, so that it reads as a coherent
whole. The grader had 3 discretionary marks to award for the overall
quality of your writing. The scale for this was:



* 3 points: excellent writing. The report flows smoothly, is easy
to read, and contains everything it should (and nothing it
shouldn't).

* 2 points: satisfactory writing. Not the easiest to read, but
says what it should, and it looks at least somewhat like a report
rather than a string of answers to questions.

* 1 point: writing that is hard to read or to understand. If you
get this (or 0), you should consider what you need to do to improve
when you write your project.

* 0 points: you answered the questions, but you did almost nothing
to make it read like a report.



(a) Create a new R Markdown document. To do this, in R Studio, select File,
New File, R Markdown. Type the report title and your name in the
boxes, and leave the output on the default HTML. Click OK. 

Solution


You'll
see the title and your name in a section at the top of the document,
and below that you'll see a template document, as you would for an R
Notebook. The difference is that where you are used to seeing
Preview, it now says "knit", but this has the same effect of
producing the formatted version of your report.    

$\blacksquare$

(b) Write an introduction that explains the purpose of this
study and the data collected in your own words.


Solution


Something like this:

> This study is intended to compare two different methods
> (labelled 1 and 2) for measuring the atomic weight of carbon
> (which is known in actual fact to be 12). Fifteen samples of
> carbon were used; ten of these were assessed using method 1 and
> the remaining five using method 2. The primary interest in this
> particular study is to see whether there is a difference in the
> mean or median atomic weight as measured by the two methods.

Before that, start a new section like this:
`## Introduction`. 
Also, get used to expressing your understanding in your words,
not mine. (Using my words, in my courses, is likely to be
worth very little.)


$\blacksquare$

(c) Begin an appropriately-titled new section in your report,
read the data into R and display the results.


Solution


Values separated by spaces:
```{r carbon-1 }
my_url <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/carbon.txt"
carbon <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
carbon
```

     

I would expect you to include, without being told to include it, some
text in your report indicating that you have sensible data: two
methods labelled 1 and 2 as promised, and a bunch^[It's  probably better in a report to use language a bit more formal than  *a bunch*. Something like *a number* would be better.] 
of atomic
weights close to the nominal figure of 12.


$\blacksquare$

(d) Make an appropriate plot to compare the measurements
obtained by the two methods. You might need to do something about
the two methods being given as numbers even though they are really
only identifiers. (If you do, your report ought to say what you did
and why.)


Solution


The appropriate plot, with a categorical method and quantitative
weight, is something like a boxplot. If you're not careful,
`method` will get treated as a quantitative variable,
which you don't want; the easiest way around that, for a boxplot
at least, is to turn it into a factor like this:

```{r seewerin}
ggplot(carbon, aes(x = factor(method), y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()
```

       

If you insist, you could do a faceted histogram (above and below, for preference):

```{r schuomarcher}
ggplot(carbon, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(bins = 5) +
  facet_wrap(~method, ncol = 1)
```

 

There are really not enough data values for a histogram to be of much
help, so I don't like this as much. 

If you are thinking ahead (we are going to be doing a $t$-test), then
you'll realize that normality is the kind of thing we're looking for,
in which case normal quantile plots would be the thing. However, we
might have to be rather forgiving for method 2 since there are only 5
observations: 

```{r mulichs}
ggplot(carbon, aes(sample = weight)) +
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() +
  facet_wrap(~method)
```

 

I don't mind these coming out side by side, though I would rather have
them squarer.

I would say, boxplots are the best, normal quantile plots are also
acceptable, but expect to lose something for histograms because they
offer only a rather crude comparison in this case.


$\blacksquare$

(e) Comment briefly on what you see in your plot.


Solution


In boxplots, if that's what you drew, there are several things
that deserve comment: the medians, the spreads and the
shapes. The median for method 1 is a little bit lower than for
method 2 (the means are probably more different, given the
shapes of the boxes). The spread for method 2 is a lot
bigger. (Looking forward, that suggests a Welch-Satterthwaite
rather than a pooled test.) As for shape, the method 2
measurements seem more or less symmetric (the whiskers are equal
anyway, even if the position of the median in the box isn't),
but the method 1 measurements have a low outlier.
The histograms are hard to compare. Try to say something about
centre and spread and shape. I think the method 2 histogram has
a slightly higher centre and definitely bigger spread. On my
histogram for method 1, the distribution looks skewed left.
If you did normal quantile plots, say something sensible about
normality for each of the two methods. For method 1, I would say
the low value is an outlier and the rest of the values look
pretty straight. Up to you whether you think there is a curve on
the plot (which would indicate skewness, but then that highest
value is too high: it would be bunched up with the other values
below 12.01 if there were really skewness). 
For method 2, it's really hard to say anything since there are
only five values. Given where the line goes, there isn't much
you can say to doubt normality.  Perhaps the best you can say
here is that in a sample of size 5, it's difficult to assess
normality at all.


$\blacksquare$

(f) Carry out the most appropriate $t$-test. (You might like to
begin another new section in your report here.)


Solution


This would be the Welch-Satterthwaite version of the two-sample
$t$-test, since the two groups do appear to have different spreads:
```{r carbon-2 }
t.test(weight ~ method, data = carbon)
```

   

Imagining that this is a report that would go to your boss, you ought
to defend your choice of the Welch-Satterthwaite test (as I did
above), and not just do the default $t$-test without comment.

If, in your discussion above, you thought the spreads were equal
enough, then you should do the pooled $t$-test here, which goes like this:

```{r carbon-3 }
t.test(weight ~ method, data = carbon, var.equal = T)
```

 

The point here is that you should do the right test based on your
conclusion. Being consistent is the most important thing. (In this
case, note that the P-values are very different. We'll get to that
shortly.)

If we were doing this in SAS, as we see later, we'd get a test at the
bottom of the output that compares the two variances. I feel that it's
just as good to eyeball the spreads and make a call about whether they
are "reasonably close". Or even, to always do the
Welch-Satterthwaite test on the basis that it is pretty good even if
the two populations have the same variance. (If this last point of
view is one that you share, you ought to say something about that when
you do your $t$-test.)

Extra: I guess this is a good place to say something about tests for comparing
variances, given that you might be pondering that. There are
several that I can think of, that R can do, of which I mention two.

The first is the $F$-test for variances that you might have learned in
B57 (that is the basis for the ANOVA $F$-test):

```{r carbon-4 }
var.test(weight ~ method, data = carbon)
```

 

This, unfortunately, is rather dependent on the data in the two groups
being approximately normal. Since we are talking variances rather than
means, there is no Central Limit Theorem to rescue us for large
samples (quite aside from the fact that these samples are *not*
large). Since the ANOVA $F$-test is based on the same theory, this is
why normality is also more important in ANOVA than it is in a $t$-test.

The second is Levene's test. This doesn't depend on normality (at
least, not nearly so much), so I like it better in general:

```{r carbon-5 }
library(car)
leveneTest(weight ~ factor(method), data = carbon)
```

 

Levene's test takes a different approach: first the absolute
differences from the group medians are calculated, and then an ANOVA
is run on the absolute differences. If, say, one of the groups has a
larger spread than the other(s), its absolute differences from the
median will tend to be bigger.^[The use of absolute  differences, and the median, downplays the influence of outliers. The assumption here is that the absolute differences from the medians are approximately normal, which seems a less big assumption than assuming the actual data are approximately normal.]
As for what we conclude here, well, neither of the variance tests show
any significance at all, so from that point of view there is no
evidence against using the pooled $t$-test. Having said that, the
samples are small, and so it would be difficult to *prove* that
the two methods have different variance, even if they actually
did.^[This is coming back to the *power* of something like Levene's test; the power of any test is not going to be very big if the sample sizes are small.]

Things are never as clear-cut as you would like. In the end, it all
comes down to making a call and defending it.


$\blacksquare$

(g) Do the most appropriate test you know that does not assume
normally-distributed data.


Solution


That would be Mood's median test. Since I didn't say anything
about building it yourself, feel free to use `smmr`:
```{r carbon-6 }
library(smmr)
median_test(carbon, weight, method)
```

 

As an aside, if you have run into a non-parametric test such as
Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis that applies in this situation, be
careful about using it here, because they have additional assumptions
that you may not want to trust. Mann-Whitney started life as a test for
"equal distributions".^[The test goes back to the 1940s.] This
means that the null is equal location *and* equal spread, and if
you reject the null, one of those has failed. But here, we suspect that
equal spread will fail, so that the Mann-Whitney test may end up
rejecting *whether or not* the medians are different, so it won't
answer the question you want an answer to. Mood's median test doesn't
have that problem; all it's saying if the null is true is that the
medians are equal; the spreads could be anything at all.

The same kind of issues apply to the signed-rank test vs. the sign
test. In the case of the signed-rank test, the extra assumption is of
a symmetric distribution --- to my mind, if you don't believe
normality, you probably don't have much confidence in symmetry
either. That's why I like the sign test and Mood's median test: in the
situation where you don't want to be dealing with assumptions, these
tests don't make you worry about that.

Another comment that you don't need to make is based on the
not-quite-significance of the Mood test. The P-value is less than 0.10
but not less than 0.05, so it doesn't quite reach significance by the
usual standard. But if you look up at the table, the frequencies seem
rather unbalanced: 6 out of the remaining 9 weights in group 1 are
below the overall median, but 4 out of 5 weights in group 2 are
above. This seems as if it ought to be significant, but bear in mind
that the sample sizes are small, and thus Mood's median test needs
*very* unbalanced frequencies, which we don't quite have here.


$\blacksquare$

(h) Discuss the results of your tests and what they say about
the two methods for measuring the atomic weight of carbon. If it
seems appropriate, put the discussion into a section called
Conclusions. 


Solution


Begin by pulling out the P-values for your preferred test(s) and
say what they mean. The P-value for the Welch-Satterthwaite
$t$-test is 0.1238, which indicates no difference in mean atomic
weights between the two methods. The Mood median test gives a
similarly non-significant 0.0943, indicating no difference in
the *median* weights. If you think both tests are
plausible, then give both P-values and do a compare-and-contrast
with them; if you think that one of the tests is clearly
preferable, then say so (and why) and focus on that test's
results. 

If you thought the pooled test was the right one, then you'll
have a bit more discussion to do, since its P-value is 0.0499,
and at $\alpha=0.05$ this test disagrees with the others. If you
are comparing this test with the Mood test, you ought to make
some kind of reasoned recommendation about which test to
believe. 

As ever, be consistent in your reasoning.

Extra: this dataset, where I found it, was actually being used to
illustrate a case where the pooled and the Welch-Satterthwaite
tests disagreed. The authors of the original paper that used
this dataset (a 1987 paper by Best and Rayner;^[Best, D. J., and J.  C. W. Rayner. “Welch’s Approximate Solution for the Behrens–Fisher Problem.” Technometrics 29, no. 2 (May 1, 1987): 205–10. doi:10.1080/00401706.1987.10488211. The data set is near the end.]
the data come from 1924!) point out that the
pooled $t$-test can be especially misleading when the smaller
sample is also the one with the larger variance. This is what
happened here.

In the Best and Rayner paper, the Mood (or the Mann-Whitney) test was
not being considered, but I think it's good practice to draw a
picture and make a call about which test is appropriate.
