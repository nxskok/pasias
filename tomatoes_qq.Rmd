##  Growth of tomatoes


 A biology graduate student exposed each of 32
tomato plants to one of four different colours of light (8 plants to
each colour). The growth rate of each plant, in millimetres per week,
was recorded. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/tomatoes.txt). 



(a) Read the data into R and confirm that you have 8 rows and 5
columns of data.



(b) Re-arrange the data so that you have *one* column
containing all the growth rates, and another column saying which
colour light each plant was exposed to. (The aim here is to produce
something suitable for feeding into `aov` later.) 



(c) Save the data in the new format to a text file. This is
most easily done using `write_csv`, which is the opposite
of `read_csv`. It requires two things: a data frame, and
the name of a file to save in, which should have a `.csv`
extension.  



(d) Make a suitable boxplot, and use it to assess the assumptions
for ANOVA. What do you conclude? Explain briefly. 



(e) Run (regular) ANOVA on these data. What do you conclude?
(Optional extra: if you think that some other variant of ANOVA would
be better, run that as well and compare the results.)



(f) If warranted, run a suitable follow-up. (If not warranted, explain briefly
why not.)
