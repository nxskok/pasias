##  Sugar in breakfast cereals


 The data for this question are in
[http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/cereal-sugar.txt](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/cereal-sugar.txt). The
story here is whether breakfast cereals marketed to children have a
lot of sugar in them; in particular, whether they have more sugar on
average than cereals marketed to adults.


(a) Read in the data (to R) and display the data set. Do you have
a variable that distinguishes the children's cereals from the
adults' cereals, and another that contains the amount of sugar?





(b) Calculate the mean sugar content for each group of cereals (the
adults' ones and the children's ones). Do they look similar or different?




(c) Make side-by-side boxplots of the sugar contents of the two
types of cereal. What do you see that is out of the ordinary? 





(d) Explain briefly why you would not trust a two-sample $t$-test
with these data. (That is, say what the problem  is, and why it's a
problem.)




(e) Run a suitable test to see whether the "typical" amount of
sugar differs between adult's and children's cereals. Justify the test
that you run. (You can use the version of your test that lives in a
package, if that is easier for you.) What do you conclude, in the
context of the data?
