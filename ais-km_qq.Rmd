##  Clustering the Australian athletes


 Recall the Australian athlete data (that we've seen so many
times before). This time, we'll do some K-means clustering, and then
see whether athletes of certain genders and certain sports tend to end
up in the same cluster.



(a) Read in the data from
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/ais.txt), recalling
that the data values are separated by tabs. Display (some of) the
data set.


(b) From your data frame, select only the columns that are numbers
(or get rid of the ones that are text), and standardize all of the
columns you have left. This is, done the best way, a slick piece of
code. Display what you get.


(c) Make a data frame that contains the total within-cluster sum
of squares from a K-means clustering for each number of clusters
from 2 to 20.


(d) Use the data frame you just created to make a scree plot. What
does the scree plot tell you?


(e) Using a sensible number of clusters as deduced from your scree
plot, run a K-means cluster analysis. Don't forget the
`nstart`! 


(f) Make a data frame consisting of the athletes' sport and
gender, and which of your clusters they belong to, taking the
appropriate things from the appropriate one of your data frames.


(g) Using the data frame you created in the previous part, display
all the athletes in some of your clusters. Do the athletes within a
cluster appear to have anything in common? (If a cluster has more
than 10 athletes in it, make sure to look at them all.)


(h) Add the cluster membership to the data frame you read in from
the file, and do a discriminant analysis treating the clusters as
known groups. You can display the output.


(i) How many linear discriminants do you have? How many do you
think are important?


(j) Which variables seem to be important in distinguishing the
clusters? Look only at the linear discriminants that you judged to
be important.


(k) Draw a biplot (which shows the first two LDs), drawing the
clusters in different colours. Comment briefly on anything
especially consistent or inconsistent with what you've seen so far.
