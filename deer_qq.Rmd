##  Deer and how much they eat


 Do adult deer eat different amounts of food at different
times of the year? The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/deer.txt) are the weights
of food (in kilograms) consumed by randomly selected adult deer
observed at different times of the year (in February, May, August and
November). We will assume that these were different deer observed in
the different months. (If the same animals had been observed at
different times, we would have been in the domain of 
"repeated measures", which would require a different analysis, 
beyond the scope
of this course.)



(a) Read the data into R, and calculate numbers of observations
and the median amounts of food
eaten each month.
 

(b) Make side-by-side boxplots of the amount of food eaten each
month. Comment briefly on what you see. 
 

(c) Run a Mood's median test as in lecture (ie.\ not using
`smmr`). What do you conclude, in the context of the data? 
 

(d) Run a Mood's median test using `smmr`, and compare the
results with the previous part.
 

(e) How is it that Mood's median test does not completely answer the
question you really want to answer? How might you get an answer to the
question you *really* want answered? Explain briefly, and obtain
the answer you *really* want, discussing your results briefly.
