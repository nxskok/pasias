##  Parking close to the curb


 In 2009, the Toronto Star commissioned a survey to address
the issue of who is better at parking a car: men or women. The
researchers recorded 93 drivers who were parallel-parking their car in
downtown Toronto, and for each driver, recorded the distance between
the car and the curb, in inches, when the driver was finished parking
their car. The data are in an Excel spreadsheet,
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/parking.xlsx).  Click on the link. The data
will probably download automatically. Check the folder on your
computer where things get downloaded.^[Mine is rather  prosaically called `Downloads`.] 
If the spreadsheet is just
displayed and not downloaded, save it somewhere on your computer.



(a) There are two sheets in this spreadsheet workbook. They are
of the same data in two different formats. Take a look at Sheet 1
and Sheet 2. Describe the format of the data in each case. Which will be the most suitable data layout, bearing in
mind that one of the first things we do is to make side-by-side
boxplots of parking distances for males and females? Explain briefly.



(b) Read your preferred sheet directly into R, *without*
using a `.csv` file. (There is a clue in the lecture notes,
in the section about reading in files.) If you get stuck, make a
`.csv` file and read that in.



(c) Obtain side-by-side boxplots of parking distances for
males and females. Does one
gender seem to be better at parking than the other? Explain briefly.



(d) Explain briefly why this is two independent samples
rather than matched pairs.



(e) Run a suitable $t$-test for comparing parking distances
for males and females. What do you conclude, in the context of the data?



(f) Why might you have some doubts about the $t$-test that
you just did? Explain briefly.



(g) The Toronto Star in its report said that females are
more accurate at parking their cars. Why do you think they
concluded that, and do you think they were right to do so?
Explain briefly.
