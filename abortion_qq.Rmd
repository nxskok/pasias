##  Attitudes towards abortion


 <a name="q:abortion">*</a> Abortion is a divisive issue in the United States,
particularly among Christians, some of whom believe that abortion is
absolutely forbidden by the Bible. Do attitudes towards abortion
differ among Christian denominations? The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/abortion.txt) come from
the American Social Survey for the years  1972--1974. The variables
are:



* `year`: year of survey, 1972, 1973 or 1974

* `religion`: Christian denomination: Southern Protestant,
other Protestant, Catholic.

* `education`: years of education: low (0--8), medium
(8--12), high (more than 12).

* `attitude` towards abortion (response). There were three abortion
questions in the survey, asking whether the respondent thought that
abortion should  be legal in these three circumstances:


* when there is a strong possibility of a birth defect

* when the mother's health is threatened

* when the pregnancy is the result of rape.

A respondent who responded "yes" to all three questions was
recorded as having a Positive attitude towards abortion; someone who
responded "no" to all three was recorded as Negative, and anyone
who gave a mixture of Yes and No responses was recorded as Mixed.

* `frequency` The number of respondents falling into the
given category combination.




(a) Read in and display the data. Do you seem to have the right
things?



(b) We have three choices for fitting logistic regressions:


* `glm` with `family="binomial"`

* `polr` (from package `MASS`)

* `multinom` (from package `nnet`)

Why should we be using `polr` for this analysis?
Explain briefly.



(c) `attitude` is text, and needs to be an ordered factor,
with the values in the right order.  Create a vector, using
`c()` if you wish, that contains the factor levels in the
right order, and then create a new `attitude` factor using
the `ordered` function, feeding it first the variable as read
from the file, and second the new ordered levels that you want it to
have.



(d) Fit a model that will predict the correctly-ordered
attitude towards abortion 
from religious denomination and education. Don't forget that each
row of the data file encodes a lot of people. You don't need to
display the results.



(e) Fit two more models, one containing `religion` only,
and the other containing `education` only. Again, no need to
look at the results.



(f) Investigate whether each of `religion` and `education`
should stay in the model, or whether they can be removed. Do this
two ways, using `drop1` and using `anova`. What do you
conclude? 



(g) Which of your fitted models is the best? Explain briefly.




(h) <a name="part:preds">*</a> 
Obtain predicted probabilities for each attitude towards abortion
for each combination of education level and religious
denomination. 




(i) Using your predictions from (<a href="#part:preds">here</a>), describe
the effect of education. (This should be the same for all values of `religion`).



(j) Using your predictions from (<a href="#part:preds">here</a>), describe
the effect of `religion`. (This should be the same for all
levels of `education`.)
