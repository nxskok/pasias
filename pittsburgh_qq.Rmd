##  Bridges in Pittsburgh


 The city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, lies where three
rivers, the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio, 
meet.
`r tufte::margin_note("For a long  time, the Pittsburgh Steelers football team played at the Three  Rivers Stadium.")` 
It has long been important to build bridges there,
to enable its residents to cross the rivers safely. See
[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridges_of_Pittsburgh) for
a listing (with pictures) of the bridges. The data at
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/bridges.csv) contains
detail for a large number of past and present bridges in
Pittsburgh. All the variables we will use are categorical. Here they
are:



* `id` identifying the bridge (we ignore)

* `river`: initial letter of river that the bridge crosses

* `location`: a numerical code indicating the location
within Pittsburgh (we ignore)

* `erected`: time period in which the bridge was built (a
name, from `CRAFTS`, earliest, to `MODERN`, most
recent.

* `purpose`: what the bridge carries: foot traffic
("walk"), water (aqueduct), road or railroad.

* `length` categorized as long, medium or short.

* `lanes` of traffic (or number of railroad tracks): a
number, 1, 2, 4 or 6, that we will count as categorical.

* `clear_g`: whether a vertical navigation requirement was
included in the bridge design (that is, ships of a certain height
had to be able to get under the bridge). I think `G` means
"yes". 

* `t_d`: method of construction. `DECK` means the
bridge deck is on top of the construction, `THROUGH` means
that when you cross the bridge, some of the bridge supports are next
to you or above you. 

* `material` the bridge is made of: iron, steel or wood.

* `span`: whether the bridge covers a short, medium or long
distance. 

* `rel_l`: Relative length of the main span of the
bridge (between the two central piers) to the total crossing length.
The categories are `S`, `S-F` and `F`. I don't
know what these mean.

* `type` of bridge: wood, suspension, arch and three types
of truss bridge: cantilever, continuous and simple.


The website [link](https://www.steelconstruction.info/Bridges) is an
excellent source of information about bridges. (That's where I learned
the difference between `THROUGH` and `DECK`.) Wikipedia
also has a good article at
[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge). I also found
[link](http://www.metaeventos.net/inscricoes/formularios_off/resumo_preenchido/DINCON/Pina-A_Colimodio-V_Silva-A_PinaFilho-A.pdf)
which is the best description I've seen of the variables.



(a) The bridges are stored in CSV format. Some of the
information is not known and was recorded in the spreadsheet as
`?`. Turn these into genuine missing values by adding
`na="?"` to your file-reading command. Display some of your
data, enough to see that you have some missing data.


(b) Verify that there are missing values in this dataset. To see
them, convert the text columns temporarily to `factor`s using
`mutate`, and pass the resulting data frame into
`summary`.


(c) Use `drop_na` to remove any rows of the data frame with missing values in them. How many rows do you have left?


(d) We are going to assess the dissimilarity between two bridges
by the number of the categorical variables they *disagree*
on. This is called a "simple matching coefficient", and is the
same thing we did in the question about clustering fruits based on
their properties. This time, though, we want to count matches in
things that are *rows* of our data frame (properties of two
different bridges), so we will need to use a strategy like the one I
used in calculating the Bray-Curtis distances.
First, write a function that takes as input two vectors `v`
and `w` and counts the number of their entries that differ
(comparing the first with the first, the second with the second,
\ldots, the last with the last. I can think of a quick way and a
slow way, but either way is good.) To test your function, create two
vectors (using `c`) of the same length, and see whether it
correctly counts the number of corresponding values that are
different. 


(e) Write a function that has as input two row numbers and a data
frame to take those rows from. The function needs to select all the
columns except for `id` and `location`, select the
rows required one at a time, and turn them into vectors. (There may
be some repetitiousness here. That's OK.)  Then those two vectors
are passed into the function you wrote in the previous part, and the
count of the number of differences is returned. This is like the
code in the Bray-Curtis problem. Test your function on rows 3 and 4
of your bridges data set (with the missings removed). There should
be six variables that are different.


(f) Create a matrix or data frame of pairwise dissimilarities
between each pair of bridges (using only the ones with no missing
values). Use loops, or `crossing` and `rowwise`, as
you prefer. Display the first six rows of
your matrix (using `head`) or the first few rows of your data
frame. (The whole thing is big, so don't display it all.)


(g) Turn your matrix or data frame into a `dist`
object. (If you couldn't create a matrix or data frame of
dissimilarities, read them in from
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/mm.csv).) Do not
display your distance object.


(h) Run a cluster analysis using Ward's method, and display a
dendrogram. The labels for the bridges (rows of the data frame) may
come out too big; experiment with a `cex` less than 1 on the
plot so that you can see them.


(i) How many clusters do you think is reasonable for these
data? Draw them on your plot.


(j) Pick three bridges in the same one of your clusters (it
doesn't matter which three bridges or which cluster). Display the
data for these bridges. Does it make sense that these three bridges
ended up in the same cluster? Explain briefly.
