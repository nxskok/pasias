##  Making soap


 A company operates two production lines in a factory for
making soap bars. The production lines are
labelled A and B. A production line that moves faster may produce more
soap, but may possibly also produce more "scrap" (that is, bits of
soap that 
can no longer be made into soap bars and will have to be thrown away).  

The data are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/soap.txt).
