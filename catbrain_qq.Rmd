##  The brain of a cat, revisited

Earlier, we looked at an ethics study that had to do with a fictional brain of a fictional cat. I said
there was actually a *town* called Catbrain. It's in England,
near Bristol, and seems to be home to a street of car dealerships.


(a) Find the latitude and longitude of "Catbrain UK" (though I don't think there are any others).


(b) Draw a map of Catbrain using Leaflet.



(c) Make a dataframe containing some other British cities as well as Catbrain, and find their latitudes and longitudes.



(d) Draw a map containing the places you picked.
