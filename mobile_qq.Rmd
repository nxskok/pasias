##  Do you like your mobile phone?


 A phone company commissioned a survey of their customers'
satisfaction with their mobile devices. The responses to the survey
were on a so-called Likert scale of "very unsatisfied",
"unsatisfied", "satisfied", "very satisfied". Also recorded were
each customer's gender and age group (under 18, 18--24, 25--30, 31 or
older). (A survey of this kind does not ask its respondents for their
exact age, only which age group they fall in.) The data, as
frequencies of people falling into each category combination, are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/mobile.txt).



(a) <a name="part:gather">*</a> Read in the data and take a look at the format. Use a tool
that you know about to arrange the frequencies in just one column,
with other columns labelling the response categories that the
frequencies belong to. Save the new data frame. (Take a look at it
if you like.)
 

(b) We are going to fit ordered logistic models below. To
do that, we need our response variable to be a factor with its levels
in the right order. By looking at the data frame
you just created, determine what kind
of thing your intended response variable currently is.




(c) If your intended response variable is not a factor, create a factor in your data frame with levels in the right order. Hint: look at the order your levels are *in the data*.




(d) <a name="part:thefit">*</a>
Fit ordered logistic models to predict satisfaction from (i) gender
and age group, (ii) gender only, (iii) age group only. (You don't
need to examine the models.) Don't forget a suitable
`weights`!
 

(e) Use `drop1` on your model containing both explanatory
variables to determine whether you can remove either of them. Use
`test="Chisq"` to obtain P-values.




(f) Use `anova` to decide whether we are justified in
removing `gender` from a model containing both `gender`
and `age.group`. Compare your P-value with the one from `drop1`.
 

(g) Use `anova` to see whether we are justified in removing
`age.group` from a model  containing both `gender` and
`age.group`. Compare your P-value with the one from
`drop1` above.
 

(h) Which of the models you have fit so far is the most
appropriate one? Explain briefly.
 

(i) Obtain predicted probabilities of a
customer falling in the various satisfaction categories, as it
depends on gender and age group. To do that, you need to feed
`predict` three things: the fitted model that contains both
age group and gender, the data frame that you read in from the file
back in part (<a href="#part:gather">here</a>) (which contains all the combinations of age group
and gender), and an appropriate `type`.

 

(j) <a name="part:unload">*</a> 
Describe any patterns you see in the predictions, bearing in mind the
significance or not of the explanatory variables.
