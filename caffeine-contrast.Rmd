##  Focused comparisons of the effect of caffeine


 
Does caffeine help students do better on a certain test? To
find out, 36 students were randomly allocated to three groups (12 in
each group).  Each student received a fixed number of cups of coffee
while they were studying, but the students didn't know whether they
were receiving all full-strength coffee ("high"), all decaf coffee
("low") or a 50-50 mixture of the two ("moderate"). For each
subject, their group was recorded as well as their score on the
test. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv), as a
`.csv` file.

This time we look at
contrasts. Suppose I knew ahead of time
that I wanted to compare moderate caffeine with high, and any
caffeine with none. (In the latter case, we're comparing 
"no caffeine" against the average of the other two groups.)

In the previous go-through of the caffeine data, we
discovered that `amount` was actually text rather than a
factor, but we also discovered that it *didn't matter*. Here it
does matter, so the first thing we have to do is to re-do the
`pivot_longer`, creating a factor version of `amount`.



(a) Read in the data again, from
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv), and
display it. This is the untidy format, so name it appropriately:


Solution


```{r }
my_url <- "http://individual.utoronto.ca/kbutler/stad29/caffeine.csv"
caffeine.untidy <- read_csv(my_url)
caffeine.untidy
```

 

One caffeine level per column, rather than a column of caffeine
levels, so untidy.


$\blacksquare$

(b) Copy your `pivot_longer` from before, only this time add
`names_ptypes = list(amount=factor())` to the end of it. Take a look at the
results. What has changed from before?


Solution


We'll save into `caffeine` again:

```{r }
caffeine.untidy %>%
  pivot_longer(-Sub, names_to="amount", values_to="score", 
               names_ptypes = list(amount=factor())) -> caffeine
caffeine
```

 

The variable created for the "names" is now a
`factor`: it was text before. Maybe we should have made it a
factor before (it wouldn't have done any harm), but we got away with
not doing so.


$\blacksquare$

(c) Using the newly tidied caffeine data, run the ANOVA 
*as a  regression* (that is, using `lm`). Look at the
`summary` of the output. What do you see?


Solution


Extra: I'm going to run the ANOVA the "old way" first, so that we can
compare results. You don't need to do this:
```{r }
caffeine.old <- aov(score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
summary(caffeine.old)
TukeyHSD(caffeine.old)
```

       

End of digression.


Now we'll do it using `lm`, with contrasts later, and see how
things change:
```{r }
caffeine.2 <- lm(score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
summary(caffeine.2)
```

       
Look at the slopes. They are `amount` followed by one of the
amounts of caffeine. R is using "high" as a baseline  (that's the
first level alphabetically), so the
`amountModerate` line is testing high vs.\ moderate: high is
*not* significantly higher, in terms of test scores, than
moderate. That's one of the things I wanted to test. What about the
coefficient for `amountNone`? That's none vs.\ *high*,
since high was the baseline. This is, as we saw from Tukey,
significant. But it is not what I said we wanted to test. 

Extra: in case you're curious, you can also get the regular analysis of
variance table as below. `anova` is multi-talented:

```{r }
anova(caffeine.2)
```

 

The problem is that you can't naturally do Tukey this way, which is
often what you want to do next. That's why we used `aov` before.

Since we have a regression model (albeit a peculiar one), we can test
whether we should remove `amount` (that is, whether it has any
impact on test scores) this way too:

```{r }
drop1(caffeine.2, test = "F")
```

 

Same conclusion: there is some effect of caffeine level on test score.


$\blacksquare$

(d) Obtain the different values of `amount`, in the order
that R has them.


Solution


Count them, or find the distinct ones:

```{r }
caffeine %>% group_by(amount) %>% summarize(count = n())
```

 

or there is this shortcut to the above:

```{r }
caffeine %>% count(amount)
```

 

Or

```{r }
caffeine %>% distinct(amount)
```

 

since we didn't really need to know how many of each there were.

These would all have worked if `amount` had been text rather a
factor. If you have a genuine `factor`, you can also ask for
its `levels`:

```{r }
with(caffeine, levels(amount))
```

 

or `summary` will count them up and list them:

```{r }
caffeine %>% select(amount) %>% summary()
```

 

This last won't work if you have a categorical-variable-as-text. It
has to be a genuine factor for it to work.

The categories are High, Moderate and None in that order.  For working
with contrasts, we need to have the thing we're making contrasts for
(see below) as a `factor`, otherwise it won't work.


$\blacksquare$

(e) Create a contrast that compares High with Moderate, ignoring
None. That is, create a vector whose length is the same as the
number of levels of `amount`, and which has a 1 to represent
High and a $-1$ to represent Moderate. 


Solution


Put a 0 in for None:
```{r }
c.hm <- c(1, -1, 0)
```

       

Having the 1 and the $-1$ the other way around would also have been fine.


$\blacksquare$

(f) Create a contrast that compares "any caffeine" against
"none" by comparing None against the average of Moderate and High.


Solution


```{r }
c.any <- c(-0.5, -0.5, 1)
```

 
Note that both our contrasts have coefficients that add up to zero, as
they must:

```{r }
sum(c.hm)
sum(c.any)
```

 


$\blacksquare$

(g) Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.


Solution


Multiply them together and check that what you get adds up to zero:
```{r }
sum(c.hm * c.any)
```

 

Zero, so orthogonal. You can check that writing `c.any` as
`c(-1,-1,2)` would also work (and still be orthogonal with
`c.hm`), and so would writing it as `c(1,1,-2)`. 


$\blacksquare$

(h) Arrange your contrasts as columns of a matrix (using
`cbind`), and say that you want to use these as contrasts for
`amount` (in data frame `caffeine` or whatever you
called it).


Solution


```{r }
m <- cbind(c.hm, c.any)
contrasts(caffeine$amount) <- m
```

 


$\blacksquare$

(i) Fit the ANOVA as an `lm`, and look at the
`summary`. What do you conclude about your contrasts?


Solution


```{r }
caff.3 <- lm(score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
summary(caff.3)
```

 

`c.hm` was the contrast between high and moderate
caffeine. This is not significant (P-value 0.142), which is the same
conclusion as Tukey, but the P-value here is quite a bit lower (and
thus closer to being significant). There's a reason for that: here we
are focusing in on the two contrasts that we really wanted to test,
and ignoring the $F$-test and the Tukey that tell us stuff that we
don't care about. By focusing our comparison, we get a better
(smaller) P-value.

`c.any` was none vs.\ average of any
caffeine. This one is significant, with a P-value of 0.023. So this
contrast tells us that having any caffeine is better than having none.


$\blacksquare$

(j) What happens if you try to use high caffeine vs.\ moderate
caffeine and moderate vs.\ none as your two contrasts?


Solution


```{r }
c.hm <- c(1, -1, 0)
c.mn <- c(0, 1, -1)
```

 

So far so good: the coefficients add up to zero and they reflect the
right comparisons. But now:

```{r }
sum(c.hm * c.mn)
```

 

This does *not* add up to zero, so these two contrasts are not
orthogonal, and we can't do what we just did. R will give us an answer
if we try it, but it'll be the *wrong* answer.
`r tufte::margin_note("SAS, for example, has a way of making non-orthogonal contrasts orthogonal in a way that the user doesn't have to worry about, but in R, you are closer to the ground, so to speak, and you have to make it happen yourself.")`

The best
description I have seen of what to do here is by David Howell,
`r tufte::margin_note("Howell is the author of a famous text on Statistics in Psychology.")` at
[link](https://www.uvm.edu/~dhowell/StatPages/More_Stuff/R/AnovaOneway.html)
(at the bottom).
Let
me try to follow his method. 

First we need a vector that is all 1's, which I have called
`c0` below. Since each of our contrasts `c.hm` and
`c.mn` have 3 things in them (3 groups), we need to add a
"dummy" 3rd contrast to give us a $3\times 3$ array of numbers:
`r tufte::margin_note("which we are going to invert, as a matrix. But I get ahead of myself.")`

```{r }
c0 <- rep(1, 3)
m <- cbind(c0, c.hm, c.mn)
m
```

 

This is what Howell calls an "augmented" matrix of contrasts, since
it has our two contrasts as the second and third columns, plus
the extra dummy one. Next we invert this matrix of contrasts,
which we can do because it's square. `t(m)` means 
"take the matrix transpose of `m`", if you're trying to keep up at the
back, and `solve` finds a matrix inverse:

```{r }
minv <- solve(t(m))
```

 

and then we remove the first column, which represents the contrast
that we didn't want anyway (what Howell calls "deaugmenting"):
`r tufte::margin_note("We are working with R matrices here rather than data frames, so we access elements, rows and columns using the square bracket notation: inside the square brackets, we put first the numbers of the rows we want, then a comma, then the numbers of the columns. There are two special pieces of notation, both of which I use here: leaving the row or column slot blank means all the rows or all the columns, and using a negative row or column number means all the rows or columns except the one(s) named. Thus my notation here is all the rows, and all the columns except for the first one. You can access data frames this way too, but the Tidyverse makes it much easier.")`

```{r }
m.contr <- minv[, -1]
m.contr
contrasts(caffeine$amount) <- m.contr
```

 

The columns of `m.contr` are our new 
contrasts. Note that they appear to be something else: high vs.\ the
average of moderate and none, and none vs.\ the average of moderate
and high. Note that they are actually
*not* orthogonal, but if Howell is to be trusted, they can be
used to test what we want. I think Howell is famous enough to be
trusted. 
Now fit the model again:

```{r }
caff.4 <- lm(score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
summary(caff.4)
```

 

The rows `amountc.hm` and `amountc.mn` are the proper tests
for our contrasts `c.hm` and `c.mn`. 
`c.hm` is not significant (P-value 0.14) and
`c.mn` is not significant either
(P-value 0.20). This is the same significance as from Tukey, but note
that the P-values for the non-significant tests are much lower than
the corresponding ones from Tukey, once again because we have focused
on just these comparisons, and not on any others. We decided ahead of
time to test just these, and gave ourselves the best chance of finding
significance that we could.

$\blacksquare$
