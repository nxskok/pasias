##  Estimating proportion in favour from a survey


 You are probably familiar with the kind of surveys where you are given a statement, like "I am the kind of person that finishes a task they start", 
and you have to express your agreement or disagreement with it. 
Usually, you are given a five-point or seven-point scale on which you express your level of agreement (from "strongly agree" 
through "neither agree nor disagree" to 
"strongly disagree", for example). Here, we will simplify things a little and only allow respondents to agree or disagree. 
So the kind of data you would have is a number of people that took part, and the number of these that said "agree".

Common assumptions that are made in this kind of analysis are:
(i) the responses are independent of each other, and (ii) each respondent has the same unknown probability of agreeing. 
You might quibble about (ii), but the assumption we are making here is that we know *nothing* about the respondents apart from whether they agreed or disagreed. 
(In practice, we'd collect all kinds of demographic information about each respondent, and this might give us a clue about how they'll respond, but here we're keeping it simple.)
Under our assumptions, the number of respondents that agree has a binomial distribution with $n$ being our sample size, and $p$ being the probability we are trying to estimate. Let's estimate $p$ using Stan: that is to say, let's obtain the posterior distribution of $p$.



(a) In R Studio, open a new Stan file (with File, New File, Stan File). 
You'll see a template file of Stan code. 
Edit the `model` section to reflect that you have observed a number of successes `x` that we are modelling to have a binomial distribution with number of trials `n` and success probability `p`.


(b) In the line of Stan code you wrote, there should be three variables.
Which of these are parameters and which are data? Explain briefly.


(c) I hope you found that there is only one parameter, `p`, in this problem. We know that $0 \le p \le 1$, and we need a prior distribution for it. A common choice is a beta distribution. 
Look at the Stan manual, [link](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_18/functions-reference/beta-distribution.html). 
The density function is given in 19.1.1. 
It has two parameters $\alpha>0$ and $\beta>0$. $B(\alpha, \beta)$ given there is a constant. 
Add to your `model` section to express that `p` has a prior distribution with parameters `alpha` and `beta`. 
(`alpha` and `beta` will be input data when we run this code.)


(d) Above your `model` section, complete a `parameters` section that says what kind of variable `p` is.
If `p` has upper or lower limits, put these in as well.
You can edit the `parameters` section that is in the template.


(e) Everything else is `data`. Complete a `data` section (edit the one in the template) to say what type of thing everything else is, including limits if it has any. 
Don't forget the parameters in the prior distribution!


(f) Save your code, if you haven't already. I used the filename `binomial.stan`. 
In your Stan code window, at the top right, you'll see a button marked Check. This checks whether your code is syntactically correct. Click it.



(g) Compile your model. (This may take a minute or so, depending on how fast your 
R Studio is.) When the spinny thing stops spinning, it's done.



(h) In most surveys, the probability to be estimated is fairly close to 0.5. 
A beta prior with $\alpha=\beta=2$ expresses the idea that any value of `p` is possible, but values near 0.5 are more likely.

A survey of 277 randomly selected adult female shoppers was taken. 69 of them agreed that when an advertised item is not available at the local supermarket, they request a raincheck.

Using the above information, set up a data `list` suitable for input to a run of `stan`.



(i) Sample from the posterior distribution of `p` with these data, and display your results.



(j) Obtain a 90\% posterior interval for the probability that a randomly chosen adult female shopper will request a raincheck.



(k) Obtain a 95\% (frequentist) confidence interval for `p`, and compare the results. (Hint: `prop.test`.) Comment briefly.



(l) (optional) This is one of those problems where you can obtain the answer analytically. What is the posterior distribution of $p$, using a prior $beta(\alpha, \beta)$ distribution for $p$ and observing $x$ successes out of $n$ trials?
