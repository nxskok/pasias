##  Mating songs in crickets


 Male tree crickets produce "mating songs" by rubbing their
wings together to produce a chirping sound. It is hypothesized that
female tree crickets identify males of the correct species by how fast
(in chirps per second) the male's mating song is. This is called the
"pulse rate".  Some data for two species of crickets are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/crickets.txt). The
columns, which are unlabelled, are temperature and pulse rate
(respectively) for *Oecanthus exclamationis* (first two
columns) and *Oecanthus niveus* (third and fourth columns). The
columns are separated by tabs. There are some missing values in the
first two columns because fewer *exclamationis* crickets than
*niveus* crickets were measured.
The research question is whether males
of the different species have different average pulse rates. It is
also of interest to see whether temperature has an effect, and if
so, what.
Before we get to that, however, we have some data organization to do.


(a) Read in the data, allowing for the fact that you have no
column names. You'll see that the
columns have names `X1` through `X4`. This is
OK.



(b) Tidy these untidy data, going as directly as you can to something tidy. (Some later parts show you how it used to be done.) Begin by: (i) adding a column of row numbers, (ii) `rename`-ing the columns to species name, an underscore, and the variable contents (keeping `pulserate` as one word), and then use `pivot_longer`. Note that the column names encode *two* things.




(c) If you found (b) a bit much to take in, the rest of the way we take a rather more leisurely approach towards the tidying. 

These data are rather far from being tidy. There need to be
three variables, temperature, pulse rate and species, and there
are $14+17=31$ observations altogether. This one is tricky in that
there are temperature and pulse rate for each of two levels of a
factor, so I'll suggest combining the temperature and chirp rate
together into one thing for each species, then pivoting them longer ("combining"),
then pivoting them wider again ("splitting"). Create new columns, named for  each species,
that contain the temperature and pulse rate for that species in
that order, `unite`d together.
For the rest of this question, start from the data frame you read
in, and build a pipe, one or two steps at a time, to save creating
a lot of temporary data frames.



(d) The two columns `exclamationis` and `niveus`
that you just created are both temperature-pulse rate combos, but
for different species. Collect them together into one
column, labelled by species. (This is a straight `tidyr` `pivot_longer`, even though the columns contain something odd-looking.)



(e) Now split up the temperature-pulse combos at the underscore, into
two separate columns. This is `separate`. When specifying
what to separate by, you can use a number ("split after this many characters") or a piece of text, in quotes ("when you see this text, split at it"). 



(f) Almost there.  Temperature and pulse rate are still text
(because `unite` turned them into text), but they should be
numbers. Create new variables that are numerical versions of
temperature and pulse rate (using `as.numeric`). Check that
you have no extraneous variables (and, if necessary, get rid of
the ones you don't want). (Species is also text and really ought
to be a factor, but having it as text doesn't seem to cause any
problems.)
You can, if you like, use `parse_number` instead of
`as.numeric`. They should both work. The distinction I
prefer to make is that `parse_number` is good for text
with a number in it (that we want to pull the number out of),
while `as.numeric` is for turning something that looks like
a number but isn't one into a genuine number.^[You could      just as well make the point that the text 20.8 contains the      number 20.8 and nothing else, so that parsing it as text in search of a number      will pull out 20.8 as a number. If that logic works for you, go      with it.]
