##  Making some R functions


 Let's write some simple R functions to convert temperatures,
and later to play with text.



(a) A temperature in Celsius is converted to one in Kelvin by
adding 273.15. (A temperature of $-273.15$ Celsius, 0 Kelvin, is the "absolute zero" 
temperature that nothing can be colder than.) Write a
function called `c_to_k` that converts an input Celsius
temperature to one in Kelvin, and test that it works.


(b) Write a function to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to
Celsius. The way you do that is to subtract 32 and then multiply by
$5/9$. 


(c) *Using the functions you already wrote*, write a function
to convert an input Fahrenheit temperature to Kelvin.


(d) Rewrite your Fahrenheit-to-Celsius convertor to take a
suitable default value and check that it works as a default.


(e) What happens if you feed your Fahrenheit-to-Celsius convertor
a *vector* of Fahrenheit temperatures? What if you use it in a
`mutate`? 


(f) Write another function called `wrap` that takes two
arguments: a piece of text called `text`, which defaults to
`hello`, and another piece of text called `outside`,
which defaults to `*`. The function returns `text`
with the text `outside` placed before and after, so that
calling the function with the defaults should return
`*hello*`. To do this, you can use `str_c` from
`stringr` (loaded with the `tidyverse`) which places
its text arguments side by side and glues them together into one
piece of text.  Test your function briefly.


(g) What happens if you want to change the default
`outside` but use the default for `text`? How do you
make sure that happens? Explore.


(h) What happens if you feed your function `wrap` a vector
for either of its arguments? What about if you use it in a
`mutate`?
