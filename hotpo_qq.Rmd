##  The Collatz sequence


 The Collatz sequence is a sequence of integers $x_1, x_2,
\ldots$ defined in a
deceptively simple way: if $x_n$ is the current term of the sequence,
then $x_{n+1}$ is defined as $x_n/2$ if $x_n$ is even, and $3x_n+1$ if
$x_n$ is odd.
We are interested in understanding how this sequence
behaves; for example, what happens to it as $n$ gets large, for
different choices of the first term $x_1$? We will explore this
numerically with R; the ambitious among you might like to look into
the mathematics of it.



(a) What happens to the sequence when it reaches 4? What would be
a sensible way of defining where it ends? Explain briefly.


(b) Write an R function called `is_odd` that returns
`TRUE` if its input is an odd number and `FALSE` if it
is even (you can assume that the input is an integer and not a
decimal number). To do *that*, you can use the function `%%` where 
`a %% b` is the remainder when `a` is divided by
`b`. To think about oddness or evenness, consider the
remainder when you divide by 2.


(c) Write an R function called
`hotpo1`^[*Hotpo* is short for half or triple-plus-one.] 
that takes an
integer as input and returns the next number in the Collatz
sequence. To do this, use the function you just wrote that
determines whether a number is even or odd.


(d) Now write a function `hotpo` that will return the whole
Collatz sequence for an input $x_1$. For this, assume that you will
eventually get to 1.


(e) Write two (very small) functions that take an entire sequence
as input and return (i) the length of the sequence and (ii) the
maximum value it attains.


(f) Make a data frame consisting of the values 11 through 20, and,
using `tidyverse` ideas, obtain a data frame containing the
Collatz sequences starting at each of those values, along with their
lengths and their maximum values. Which sequence is longest? Which
one goes up highest?
