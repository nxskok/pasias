##  Predicting volume of wood in pine trees


 In forestry, the financial value of a tree
is the volume of wood that it contains. This is difficult to estimate
while the tree is still standing, but the diameter is easy to measure
with a tape measure (to measure the circumference) and a calculation
involving $\pi$, assuming that the cross-section of the tree is at
least approximately circular.  The standard measurement is
"diameter at breast height" 
(that is, at the height of a human breast or
chest), defined as being 4.5 feet above the ground.

Several pine trees had their diameter measured shortly before being
cut down, and for each tree, the volume of wood was recorded. The data
are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/pinetrees.txt). The
diameter is in inches and the volume is in cubic inches.  Is it
possible to predict the volume of wood from the diameter?



(a) Read the data into R and display the values (there are not
very many).



(b) Make a suitable plot.



(c) Describe what you learn from your plot about the
relationship between diameter and volume, if anything.



(d) Fit a (linear) regression, predicting volume from diameter,
and obtain the `summary`. How would you describe the R-squared?



(e) Draw a graph that will help you decide whether you trust
the linearity of this regression. What do you conclude? Explain briefly.



(f) What would you guess would be the volume of a tree of
diameter zero? Is that what the regression predicts? Explain briefly.



(g) A simple way of modelling a tree's shape is to pretend it is a
cone, like this, but probably taller and skinnier:

with its base on the ground. What is the relationship between the
*diameter* (at the base) and volume of a cone? (If you don't
remember, look it up. You'll probably get a formula in terms of the
radius, which you'll have to convert.
Cite the website you used.)



(h) Fit a regression model that predicts volume from diameter
according to the formula you obtained in the previous part. You can
assume that the trees in this data set are of similar heights, so
that the height can be treated as a constant.  
Display the
results.
