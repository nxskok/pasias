##  Children's stress levels and airports


 If you did STAC32, you might remember this question, which
we can now do properly. Some of this question is a repeat from there.

The data in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/airport.txt)
are based on a 1998 study of stress levels in children as a result of
the building of a new airport in Munich, Germany. A total of 200
children had their epinephrine levels (a stress indicator) measured at
each of four different times: before the airport was built, and 6, 18
and 36 months after it was built. The four measurements are labelled
`epi_1` through `epi_4`.  Out of the children, 100
were living near the new airport (location 1 in the data set), and
could be expected to suffer stress because of the new airport. The
other 100 children lived in the same city, but outside the noise
impact zone. These children thus serve as a control group. The
children are identified with numbers 1 through 200.



(a) If we were testing for the effect of time, explain briefly
what it is about the structure of the data that would make an
analysis of variance *inappropriate*.



(b) Read the data into R and demonstrate that you have the right
number of observations and variables.



(c) Create and save a "longer" data frame with all the epinephrine
values collected together into one column.



(d) Make a "spaghetti plot" of these data: that is, a plot of
epinephrine levels against time, with the locations identified by
colour, and the points for the same child joined by lines.  To do
this: (i) from the long data frame, create a new column containing
only the numeric values of time (1 through 4), (ii) plot epinephrine
level against time with the points grouped by child and coloured by
location (which you may have to turn from a number into a factor.)



(e) What do you see on your spaghetti plot? We are looking ahead
to possible effects of time, location and their interaction.



(f) The spaghetti plot was hard to interpret because there are
so many children. Calculate the mean epinephrine levels for each
location-time combination, and make an interaction plot with time
on the $x$-axis and location as the second factor.



(g) What do you conclude from your interaction plot? Is your
conclusion clearer than from the spaghetti plot?



(h) Run a repeated-measures analysis of variance and display the
results. Go back to your original data frame, the one you read in
from the file, for this. You'll need to make sure your numeric
`location` gets treated as a `factor`.



(i) What do you conclude from the MANOVA? Is that consistent
with your graphs? Explain briefly.
