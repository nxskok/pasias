##  Clustering the Swiss bills


 This question is about the Swiss bank counterfeit bills
again. This time we're going to ignore whether each bill is
counterfeit or not, and see what groups they break into. Then, at
the end, we'll see whether cluster analysis was able to pick out the
counterfeit ones or not.


(a) Read the data in again (just like last time), and look at
the first few rows. This is just the same as before.
 

(b) The variables in this data frame are on different
scales. Standardize them so that they all have mean 0 and standard
deviation 1. (Don't try to standardize the `status` column!)
 

(c) We are going to make a scree plot. First, calculate the total
within-cluster SS for each number of clusters from 2 to 10.
 

(d) <a name="part:howmany">*</a> Make a scree plot (creating a data frame
first if you need). How many clusters do you think you
should use?
 

(e) Run K-means with the number of clusters that you found in
(<a href="#part:howmany">here</a>). How many bills are in each cluster?
 

(f) Make a table showing cluster membership against actual
status (counterfeit or genuine). Are the counterfeit bills mostly
in certain clusters?
