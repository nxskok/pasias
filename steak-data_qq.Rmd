##  How do you like your steak -- the data


  <a name="q:steak-data">*</a> 
This question takes you through the data preparation for one
of the other questions. You don't have to do *this*
question, but you may find it interesting or useful.

When you order a steak in a restaurant, the server will ask
you how you would like it cooked, or to be precise, *how much*
you would like it cooked: rare (hardly cooked at all), through medium
rare, medium, medium well to well (which means "well done", so that
the meat has only a little red to it). Could you guess how a person
likes their steak cooked, from some other information about them? The
website [link](fivethirtyeight.com) commissioned a survey where they
asked a number of people how they preferred their steak, along with as
many other things as they could think of to ask. (Many of the
variables below are related to risk-taking, which was something the
people designing the survey thought might have something to do with
liking steak rare.) The variables of interest are all factors or true/false:



* `respondent_ID`: a ten-digit number identifying each
person who responded to the survey.

* `lottery_a`: true if the respondent preferred lottery A
with a small chance to win a lot of money, to lottery B, with a
larger chance to win less money.

* `smoke`: true if the respondent is currently a smoker

* `alcohol`: true if the respondent at least occasionally
drinks alcohol.

* `gamble`: true if the respondent likes to gamble (eg.
betting on horse racing or playing the lottery)

* `skydiving`: true if the respondent has ever been
skydiving.

* `speed`: true if the respondent likes to drive fast

* `cheated`: true if the respondent has ever cheated on a
spouse or girlfriend/boyfriend

* `steak`: true if the respondent likes to eat steak

* `steak_prep` (response): how the respondent likes their
steak cooked (factor, as described above, with 5 levels).

* `female`: true if the respondent is female

* `age`: age group, from 18--29 to 60+.

* `hhold_income`: household income group, from \$0--24,999
to \$150,000+.

* `educ`: highest level of education attained, from 
"less  than high school" 
up to "graduate degree"

* `region`: region (of the US)
that the respondent lives in (five values).


The data are in
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/steak.csv). 



(a) Read in the data and display the first few lines.



(b) What do you immediately notice about your data frame? Run `summary` on the entire data frame. Would you say you have a lot of missing values, or only a few?


(c) What does the function `drop_na` do when applied to a data frame with missing values? To find out, pass the data frame into `drop_na()`, then into `summary` again. What has happened?


(d) Write the data into a `.csv` file, with a name like
`steak1.csv`.  Open this file in a spreadsheet and (quickly)
verify that you have the right columns and no missing values.
