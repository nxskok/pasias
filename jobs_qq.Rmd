##  What distinguishes people who do different jobs?


 244^[Grammatically, I am supposed to write this as  "two hundred and forty-four" in words, since I am not supposed to  start a sentence with a number. But, I say, deal with it. Or, I  suppose, "there are 244 people who work...".] people work at a
certain company. 
They each have one of three jobs: customer service, mechanic,
dispatcher. In the data set, these are labelled 1, 2 and 3
respectively.  In addition, they each are rated on scales called
`outdoor`, `social` and `conservative`. Do people
with different jobs tend to have different scores on these scales, or,
to put it another way, if you knew a person's scores on
`outdoor`, `social` and `conservative`, could you
say something about what kind of job they were likely to hold? The
data are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jobs.txt).



(a) Read in the data and display some of it.



(b) Note the types of each of the variables, and create any new
variables that you need to.



(c) Run a multivariate analysis of variance to convince yourself
that there are some differences in scale scores among the jobs.



(d) Run a discriminant analysis and display the output.



(e) Which is the more important, `LD1` or `LD2`? How
much more important? Justify your answer briefly.



(f) Describe what values for an individual on the scales will make
each of `LD1` and `LD2` high. 



(g) The first group of employees, customer service, have the
highest mean on `social` and the lowest mean on both of the
other two scales. Would you expect the customer service employees to
score high or low on `LD1`? What about `LD2`?



(h) Plot your discriminant scores (which you will have to obtain
first), and see if you were right about the customer service
employees in terms of `LD1` and `LD2`. The job names
are rather long, and there are a lot of individuals, so it is
probably best to plot the scores as coloured circles with a legend
saying which colour goes with which job (rather than labelling each
individual with the job they have).



(i) <a name="part:predjob">*</a> Obtain predicted job allocations for each individual (based on
their scores on the three scales), and tabulate the true jobs
against the predicted jobs. How would you describe the quality of
the classification? Is that in line with what the plot would suggest?



(j) Consider an employee with these scores: 20 on
`outdoor`, 17 on `social` and 8 on `conservative` What job do you think
they do, and how certain are you about that? Use `predict`,
first making a data frame out of the values to predict for.



(k) Since I am not making you hand this one in, I'm going to keep
going. Re-run the analysis to incorporate cross-validation, and make
a table of the predicted group memberships. Is it much different
from the previous one you had? Why would that be?
