##  European Social Survey and voting


 The European Social Survey is a giant survey carried out
across Europe covering demographic information, attitudes to and
amount of education, politics and so on. In this question, we will
investigate what might make British people vote for a certain
political party.

The information for this question is in a (large) spreadsheet at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ess.csv). There is also a
"codebook" at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ess-codebook.pdf) that
tells you what all the variables are. The ones we will use are the
last five columns of the spreadsheet, described on pages 11 onwards of
the codebook. (I could have given you more, but I didn't want to make
this any more complicated than it already was.)



(a) Read in the `.csv` file, and verify that you have lots
of rows and columns.
 

(b) <a name="part:whatvar">*</a> Use the codebook to find out what the columns
`prtvtgb`, `gndr`, `agea`, `eduyrs` and
`inwtm` are.  What do the values 1 and 2 for `gndr`
mean? (You don't, at this point, have to worry about the values for
the other variables.)
 

(c) The three major political parties in Britain are the
Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat. (These, for your
information, correspond roughly to the Canadian Progressive
Conservative, NDP and Liberal parties.) For the variable that
corresponds to "political party voted for at the last election",
which values correspond to these three parties?
 

(d) Normally, I would give you a tidied-up
data set. But I figure you could use some practice tidying this one
up. As the codebook shows, there are some numerical codes for
missing values, and we want to omit those.
We want just the columns `prtvtgb` through `inwtm`
from the right side of the spreadsheet.  Use `dplyr` or
`tidyr` tools to (i) select only these columns, (ii) include
the rows that correspond to people who voted for one of the three
major parties, (iii) include the rows that have an age at interview
less than 999, (iv) include the rows that have less than 40 years of
education, (v) include the rows that are not missing on
`inwtm` (use the idea from Question~<a href="#part:prepare-next">here</a>
for (v)).  The last four of those (the inclusion of rows) can be
done in one go.
 

(e) Why is my response variable nominal rather than  ordinal? How can I tell?
Which R function should I use, therefore, to fit my model?
 

(f) <a name="part:full">*</a> Take the political party voted for, and turn it into a
factor, by feeding it into `factor`.
Fit an appropriate model to predict political party voted
for at the last election (as a factor) from all the other
variables. Gender is really a categorical variable too, but since
there are only two possible values it can be treated as a number.
 

(g) We have a lot of explanatory variables. The standard way to
test whether we need all of them is to take one of them out at a time,
and test which ones we can remove. This is a lot of work. We won't do
that. Instead,
the R function `step` does what you want. You feed `step`
two things: a fitted model object, and the option `trace=0`
(otherwise you get a lot of output). The final part of the output from
`step` tells you which explanatory variables you need to keep.
Run `step` on your fitted model. Which explanatory variables
need to stay in the model here?

 

(h) Fit the model indicated by `step` (in the last part).

 

(i) I didn't think that interview length could possibly be
relevant to which party a person voted for. Test whether interview
length can be removed from your model of the last part. What do you
conclude? (Note that `step` and this test may disagree.)

 

(j) Use your best model to obtain predictions from some
suitably chosen combinations of values of the explanatory variables
that remain. (If you have quantitative explanatory variables left,
you could use their first and third quartiles as values to predict
from. Running `summary` on the data frame will get summaries
of all the variables.)
 

(k) What is the effect of increasing age? What is the effect of
an increase in years of education?
