##  Test scores in two classes


  Open R Studio. Create a new Text File by selecting File, New File
and Text File. You should see a new empty, untitled window appear at
the top left. In that window, type or copy the data below (which are
scores on a test for students in two different classes):

```

class score
ken 78
ken 62
ken 59
ken 69
ken 81
thomas 83
thomas 77
thomas 63
thomas 61
thomas 79
thomas 72

```

Save the file, using a filename of your choice (with, perhaps, extension
`.txt`). Or, if you prefer, use the one at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/marks.txt). 


(a) Read the data into a data frame called `marks`, using
`read_delim`, and list the data frame (by typing its name)
to confirm that you read the data values properly. Note that the
top line of the data file contains the names of the variables, as
it ought to.



(b) <a name="part:sbsbox">*</a> Obtain side-by-side boxplots of the scores for each class.
 
 

(c) Do the two classes appear to have similar or different
scores, on average? Explain briefly. 
 

(d) Obtain a boxplot of all the scores together, regardless
of which class they came from. 



(e) Compute the median score (of all the scores
together). Does this seem about right, looking at the boxplot?
Explain briefly.
