##  Who studies the most outside class?


 A social scientist wanted to see how many hours students
 studied outside of class. She took a random sample of 75 students
 from three different majors: math, social science and English, and
 recorded the number of weekly outside-class study hours for each
 student. The data can be found at
 [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/studyhours.txt). The
 social scientist had two research questions: whether math students study
 more outside of class than the other students, and whether English and
 social science students study different amounts of time outside class.


(a) Explain briefly why contrasts would be a better idea here
than ANOVA with Tukey.



(b) Read in the data and make side-by-side boxplots of study
hours by major. What do the boxplots suggest about the comparisons
that the researcher wants to make?



(c) Set up contrasts for each of the researcher's research
questions, bearing in mind the levels of `major` and the
order in which they come. (For the `Math` contrast, you want
Math against the average of the other two.)



(d) Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.



(e) Create a matrix of contrasts (using `cbind`) and let
`lm` know that these are contrasts for `major`, in
data frame `studyhours` (or whatever you called it).



(f) Fit the model using `lm`. What do you conclude about
your contrasts?



(g) Are you surprised by the significance or non-significance you
found in the previous part? Explain briefly.
