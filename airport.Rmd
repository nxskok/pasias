##  Children's stress levels and airports


 If you did STAC32, you might remember this question, which
we can now do properly. Some of this question is a repeat from there.

The data in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/airport.txt)
are based on a 1998 study of stress levels in children as a result of
the building of a new airport in Munich, Germany. A total of 200
children had their epinephrine levels (a stress indicator) measured at
each of four different times: before the airport was built, and 6, 18
and 36 months after it was built. The four measurements are labelled
`epi_1` through `epi_4`.  Out of the children, 100
were living near the new airport (location 1 in the data set), and
could be expected to suffer stress because of the new airport. The
other 100 children lived in the same city, but outside the noise
impact zone. These children thus serve as a control group. The
children are identified with numbers 1 through 200.



(a) If we were testing for the effect of time, explain briefly
what it is about the structure of the data that would make an
analysis of variance *inappropriate*.


Solution


It is the fact that each child was measured four times, rather
than each measurement being on a *different* child (with
thus $4\times 200=800$ observations altogether). It's
the same distinction as between matched pairs and a two-sample
$t$ test.



(b) Read the data into R and demonstrate that you have the right
number of observations and variables.


Solution


The usual, data values separated by one space:

```{r }
my_url <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/airport.txt"
airport <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
airport
```

 

There are 200 rows (children), with four `epi` measurements, a
location and a child identifier, so that looks good.

(I am mildly concerned about the negative `epi` measurements,
but I don't know what the scale is, so presumably they are all
right. Possibly epinephrine is measured on a log scale, so that a
negative value here is less than 1 on the original scale that we don't
see.)



(c) Create and save a "longer" data frame with all the epinephrine
values collected together into one column.


Solution

`pivot_longer`:

```{r }
airport %>% pivot_longer(starts_with("epi"), names_to="when", values_to="epinephrine") -> airport.long
airport.long
```

 

Success. I'm saving the name `time` for later, so I've called
the time points `when` for now. There were 4 measurements on
each of 200 children, so the long data frame should (and does) have
$200\times 4 = 800$ rows.



(d) Make a "spaghetti plot" of these data: that is, a plot of
epinephrine levels against time, with the locations identified by
colour, and the points for the same child joined by lines.  To do
this: (i) from the long data frame, create a new column containing
only the numeric values of time (1 through 4), (ii) plot epinephrine
level against time with the points grouped by child and coloured by
location (which you may have to turn from a number into a factor.)


Solution

Note the use of the different things for `colour` and `group`, as usual for a spaghetti plot. Also, note that the locations are identified by number, but the number is only a label, and we want to use different colours for the different locations, so we need to turn `location` into a factor for this. 

```{r toofat}
airport.long %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(when)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = epinephrine, colour = factor(location), group = child)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

`r tufte::margin_note("The term accidental aRt is sometimes used for graphs that cross the boundary between being informative and looking like a piece of art, particularly if it was not done on purpose. This one is a bit like that.")`
         

This is different from the plot we had in C32, where I had you use a
different colour for each *child*, and we ended up with a huge
legend of all the children (which we then removed). 

If you forget to turn `location` into a factor, `ggplot`
will assume that you want `location` to be on a continuous
scale, and you'll get two shades of blue. 

Another problem with this plot is that there are so many children, you
can't see the ones underneath because the ones on top are overwriting
them. The solution to that is to make the lines (partly) transparent,
which is controlled by a parameter `alpha`:
`r tufte::margin_note("This is  different from the 0.05 *alpha*.")`

```{r skinnier}
airport.long %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(when)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = epinephrine, colour = factor(location), group = child)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line(alpha = 0.2)
```

   
It seems to make the lines skinnier, so they look more like
threads. Even given the lesser thickness, they seem to be a little bit
see-through as well. You can experiment with adding transparency to
the points in addition. 



(e) What do you see on your spaghetti plot? We are looking ahead
to possible effects of time, location and their interaction.


Solution


This is not clear, so it's very much your call.
I see the red spaghetti strands as going up further
(especially) and maybe down further than the blue ones. The
epinephrine levels of the children near the new airport are
definitely more spread out, and maybe have a higher mean, than
those of the control group of children not near the airport.
The red spaghetti strands show something of an increase over
time, at least up to time 3, after which they seem to drop
again. The blue strands, however, don't show any kind of trend
over time. Since the time trend is different for the two
locations, I would expect to see a significant interaction.



(f) The spaghetti plot was hard to interpret because there are
so many children. Calculate the mean epinephrine levels for each
location-time combination, and make an interaction plot with time
on the $x$-axis and location as the second factor.


Solution


We've done this before:
```{r }
airport.long %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(when)) %>%
  mutate(floc = factor(location)) %>%
  group_by(floc, time) %>%
  summarize(mean.epi = mean(epinephrine)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = mean.epi, group = floc, colour = floc)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

         

I wanted the actual numerical times, so I made them again. Also, it
seemed to be easier to create a factor version of the numeric location
up front, and then use it several times later. I'm actually not sure
that you need it here, since `group_by` works with the
distinct values of a variable, whatever they are, and `group`
in a boxplot may or may not insist on something other than a number. I
should try it:

```{r }
airport.long %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(when)) %>%
  group_by(location, time) %>%
  summarize(mean.epi = mean(epinephrine)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = mean.epi, group = location, colour = location)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

          

It seems that `colour` requires a non-number:

```{r }
airport.long %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(when)) %>%
  group_by(location, time) %>%
  summarize(mean.epi = mean(epinephrine)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = mean.epi, group = location, colour = factor(location))) +
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

         
With a long pipeline like this, none of us get it right the first time (I
certainly didn't), so be prepared to debug it one line at a time. The
way I like to do this is to take the pipe symbol and move it down to
the next line (moving the cursor to just before it and hitting
Enter). This ends the pipe at the end of *this* line and displays
what it produces so far. When you are happy with that, go to the start
of the next line (that currently has a pipe symbol by itself) and hit
Backspace to move the pipe symbol back where it was. Then go to the
end of the next line (where the next pipe symbol is), move *that*
to a line by itself, and so on. Keep going until each line produces
what you want, and when you are finished, the whole pipeline will do
what you want.



(g) What do you conclude from your interaction plot? Is your
conclusion clearer than from the spaghetti plot?


Solution


The two "traces" are not parallel, so I would expect to see
an interaction between location and time. The big difference
seems to be between times 1 and 2; the traces are the same at
time 1, and more or less parallel after time 2. Between times
1 and 2, the mean epinephrine level of the children near the
new airport increases sharply, whereas for the children in the
control group it increases much less.
This, to my mind, is very much easier to interpret than the
spaghetti plot, even the second version with the thinner
strands, because there is a lot of variability there that
obscures the overall pattern. The interaction plot is plain as
day, but it might be an oversimplification because it doesn't
show variability.



(h) Run a repeated-measures analysis of variance and display the
results. Go back to your original data frame, the one you read in
from the file, for this. You'll need to make sure your numeric
`location` gets treated as a `factor`.


Solution


The usual process. I'll try the other way I used of making the
`response`: 
```{r }
airport %>%
  select(epi_1:epi_4) %>%
  as.matrix() -> response
airport.1 <- lm(response ~ factor(location), data = airport)
times <- colnames(response)
times.df <- data.frame(times=factor(times))
airport.2 <- Manova(airport.1, idata = times.df, idesign = ~times)
airport.2
```

         



(i) What do you conclude from the MANOVA? Is that consistent
with your graphs? Explain briefly.


Solution


We start and end with the significant interaction: there is an
effect of location, but the nature of that effect depends on
time. This is the same as we saw in the interaction plot:
from time 2 on, the mean epinephrine levels for the children near
the new airport were clearly higher. 
If you stare at the spaghetti plot, you *might* come to
the same conclusion. Or you might not! I suppose those red
dots at time 2 are mostly at the top, and generally so
afterwards, whereas at time 1 they are all mixed up with the
blue ones.
Interactions of this sort in this kind of analysis  are very
common. There is an "intervention" or "treatment", and the
time points are chosen so that the first one is before the
treatment happens, and the other time points are after. Then,
the results are very similar for the first time point, and
very different after that, rather than being (say) always
higher for the treatment group by about the same amount for
all times (in which case there would be no interaction). 
So, you have some choices in practice as to how you might
go. You might do the MANOVA, get a significant interaction,
and draw an interaction plot to see why. You might stop there,
or you might do something like what we did in class: having
seen that the first time point is different from the others
for reasons that you can explain, do the analysis again, but
omitting the first time point. For the MANOVA, that means
tweaking your definition of your `response` to omit the
first time point. The rest of it stays the same, though you
might want to change your model numbers rather than re-using
the old ones as I did:
```{r }
airport %>%
  select(epi_2:epi_4) %>%
  as.matrix() -> response
airport.1 <- lm(response ~ factor(location), data = airport)
times <- colnames(response)
times.df <- data.frame(times=factor(times))
airport.2 <- Manova(airport.1, idata = times.df, idesign = ~times)
airport.2
```

         

The interaction is still significant, so there is still not a
consistent effect of being near the new airport on epinephrine levels:
that is to say, the effect of the new airport *still* varies over
time. That might be because (looking at the interaction plot) for the
children near the new airport, the mean epinephrine level went up
again between times 2 and 3, whereas for the control children it (for
some reason) went dramatically down over the same time period.

We have lots of data here (200 children), so the significant
interaction effect also might not be very big.

Experimental designs like this are kind of awkward, because you expect
there to be some kind of pattern over time for the treatment group,
that will vary over time, whereas for the control group, you expect
there to be no pattern over time. So a significant difference shows up
as an *interaction*, which is messier to interpret than you would
like. 

Extra: the other way to analyze repeated measures data 
`r tufte::margin_note("This is something *I* want to  understand, so I will share my findings with you. You can read them  or not, as you choose.")` is to treat them as "mixed models", which
requires a different kind of analysis using the `lme4`
package. I always forget how these go, and I have to look them up when
I need them, but the idea is this: the treatments you observe, and the
time points at which you observe them, are
typically the only ones you care about (a so-called "fixed effect"),
but the individuals (children, here)
which you happen to observe are
something like a random sample of all the children you might have
observed (a so-called "random effect"). Models with random effects
in them are called "mixed models" (or, I suppose, models with both
fixed and random effects). This matters because you have repeated
observations on the *same* child. Some people like to think of
this in terms of "sources of variability": the epinephrine levels
vary because of the location and time at which they were observed, but
also because of the particular child they happen to have been observed
for: each child has a "random effect" that they carry with them
through all the time points at which they are observed.

Let's see if we can make it fly for this example. We need the data in
"long" format, the way we arranged it for graphing: the data frame
`airport.long`. I'd like to convert things to factors first:

```{r }
airport.long %>% mutate(
  fchild = factor(child),
  flocation = factor(location)
) -> fairport

airport.3 <- lmer(epinephrine ~ flocation * when + (1 | fchild), data = fairport)
anova(airport.3)
drop1(airport.3, test = "Chisq")
```

 

The `anova` doesn't actually give us any tests, but what you
see in the ANOVA table are the fixed effects. These are testable. The
easiest way to see what you can get rid of is `drop1`; the
chi-squared test appears to be the right one (more on that
below). This says that the interaction is strongly significant, and we
should not consider removing it, the same conclusion as our 
"profile analysis" before.
The other choice for
testing is to fit a model without what you
are testing and use `anova` to compare the two models:

```{r }
airport.4 <- update(airport.3, . ~ . - flocation:when)
anova(airport.4, airport.3)
```

 

There are technical considerations involved in comparing the fit of
two models (which is the reason for the 
"refitting models with..."): there is one method for estimating and a different
method for testing. The test is based on "likelihood ratio", which
means that the right test for the `drop1` above is
`Chisq`. 

If you omit the test in `drop1`, it just gives
you AIC values, which you can use for an informal assessment. In this
case, `<none>` has a much smaller AIC than the interaction
(smaller by over 50), so there's no way we should entertain taking out
the interaction. However, if it had not been significant, we would
just take it out by fitting a model like `airport4`: there is
no distinction here between "within-subject" and 
"between-subject"
factors that prevented us from taking the interaction out in profile
analysis. 

As ever when an interaction is significant, we might think  about
simple effects: that is, look at the two locations separately. That
makes sense here because of the kind of experimental design it is: we
*expect* a different kind of relationship with time for the
"treatment" children (the ones living near the new airport) as
compared to the control children, the ones who live farther away. That
approach would work with either the profile-analysis way using
`Manova` or the mixed-modelling way using `lmer`. In
either case, we'd expect to see a time effect at location 1 but not at
location 2. (Having separated out locations, only the time effect
would be left for testing.) I guess I have to show you that, but I
have to get ready for class first.

Later\ldots

The nice thing about Wednesday evenings is that I am so tired from
class that I have energy for almost nothing except playing with these
things. So let's have a crack at it. 

Let's start with location 1, at which we expect there to be
something happening. This is really a simple effect of time at
location 1, but in repeated measures guise. The awkwardness is that
the profile analysis needs the wide-format data, while the mixed-model
analysis needs long format, so we'll have to repeat our process, once
for each format of data set:

```{r }
loc1 <- airport %>% filter(location == 1)
response <- loc1 %>% select(epi_1:epi_4) %>% as.matrix()
loc1.1 <- lm(response ~ 1, data = loc1)
times <- colnames(response)
times.df <- data.frame(times=factor(times))
loc1.2 <- Manova(loc1.1, idata = times.df, idesign = ~times)
loc1.2
```

 

This is one of those times where a pipe doesn't quite do it. We need
to grab the data for location 1, but then we need to do two things
with it: one, create a response variable, and two, feed the response
variable *and* the location 1 data into `lm`. Pipes are
for linear sequences of things to do, and this one diverges. So, save
what you need to save, and then do it without a pipe.

This is one of those explanatory-variable-less repeated measures where
you *only* have things varying over time. Here, the treatment was
location, and we're only looking at one of those locations. We still
have a within-subject design (the four times), but there is no
between-subject design left.

The conclusion is that there is very strong evidence of a time effect
for location 1, as we would have guessed.

Now, let's see whether the mixed-model analysis comes to the same
conclusion. This time, we have to start from the *long* data set
(the one I'm using is the one called `fairport` with things as
factors) and pull out the rows for location 1. The only remaining
fixed effect is time:

```{r }
fairport %>%
  filter(location == 1) %>%
  lmer(epinephrine ~ when + (1 | fchild), data = .) %>%
  drop1(test = "Chisq")
```

 

The effect of time is, once again, substantial. The P-value is not the
same, because the test is not the same, but it is very similar and
points to exactly the same conclusion.

I should perhaps point out that you don't *have* to do these
models in a pipe. I just did because it was easier for me. But there's
nothing wrong with doing it like this:

```{r }
tmp <- fairport %>% filter(location == 1)
tmp.1 <- lmer(epinephrine ~ when + (1 | child), data = tmp)
drop1(tmp.1, test = "Chisq")
```

 

and it gives exactly the same result.

This last model (in either of its versions) is a so-called random
intercepts model. What it says is that epinephrine level for a child
depends on time, but the effect of being one child rather than another
is to shunt the mean epinephrine level up or down by a fixed amount
for all times. It seems to me that this is a very reasonable way to
model the child-to-child variation in this case, but in other cases,
things might be different. `lmer` allows more sophisticated
things, like for example the random child effect depending linearly on
time. To do that, you'd rewrite the above like this:

```{r eval=F}
fairport %>%
  filter(location == 1) %>%
  lmer(epinephrine ~ when + (1 + when | fchild), data = .) %>%
  drop1(test = "Chisq")
```

 

The change is on the `lmer` line: the bit in brackets has a
linear model in `when` for each child. I didn't run that, so
I'm not certain it works,
`r tufte::margin_note("I'm suspicious about *when*  needing to be the numerical time inside. Not sure.")` but that's the idea.

All right, let's get on to location 2. This was the control location,
so we expect to see *no* dependence of epinephrine level on time,
either in the profile analysis or in the mixed-model analysis. There
is a large amount of copying and pasting coming up:

```{r }
airport %>% filter(location == 2) -> loc2
loc2 %>% select(epi_1:epi_4) %>% as.matrix() -> response
loc2.1 <- lm(response ~ 1, data = loc1)
times <- colnames(response)
times.df <- data.frame(times=factor(times))
loc2.2 <- Manova(loc2.1, idata = times.df, idesign = ~times)
loc2.2
```

 

I think I changed everything I needed to. 

There actually *is* still an effect of time. What kind of effect?
We can look at that by finding epinephrine means at each time. That
would be easier if we had long format, but I think we can still do
it. The magic word is `across`:

```{r }
airport %>%
  filter(location == 2) %>%
  summarize(across(starts_with("epi"), ~mean(.)))
```

(in words, "for each column that starts with `epi`, find the mean of it.")
 

The message here is that the mean epinephrine levels at time 2 were
higher than the others, so that's what seems to be driving the time
effect. And remember, these were the control children, so they had no
new airport nearby.

I want to try this:

```{r }
airport %>% nest_by(location)
```

 

This is like the idea in the Spilich problem: I want to write a
function that calculates the means of the `epi_1` through
`epi_4` columns of a data frame like `airport`, and
then apply it to each of those "nested" data frames.

```{r }
epi.means <- function(x) {
  x %>% summarize(across(starts_with("epi"), ~mean(.)))
}

epi.means(airport)
```

 

OK, and then:

```{r }
airport %>%
  nest_by(location) %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(means = list(epi.means(data))) %>%
  unnest(means)
```

 

Ooh, nice. There are the means for the four time points at both of the
two locations. At location 1, epinephrine starts out low, jumps high
after the airport is built, and stays there, while at location 2, the
mean is mysteriously higher at time 2 and then epinephrine levels go
back down again.

Enough of that. Back to the mixed model analysis, with more copying
and pasting. Here is the "simple time effect" at location 2:

```{r }
fairport %>%
  filter(location == 2) %>%
  lmer(epinephrine ~ when + (1 | fchild), data = .) %>%
  drop1(test = "Chisq")
```

 

This also finds a time effect at location 2, with a very similar P-value.

So which method is preferred? They are, I think, two different ways of
approaching the same problem, and so there is no good reason to prefer
one way over the other. The profile-analysis way is easier to follow
if you are coming from a MANOVA direction: set it up the same way as
you would a MANOVA, with your repeated measures as your multivariate
response, and distinguish between the within-subject design (times,
for us) and the between-subject design (treatments, stuff like
that). As for mixed models: when you get your head around that crazy
way of specifying the random effects, which are typically "subjects"
in this kind of analysis, the actual model statement is brief:
response depends on fixed effects plus random effects with the
brackets and vertical bar. I always find the `lmer` models look
very simple once you have figured them out (like `ggplot` in
that regard). I also like the fact that `lmer` uses "tidy data", 
so that you can make graphs and do this flavour of analysis
with the same data frame. Having gotten my head around getting my data
tidy, it seems odd to me that profile analysis requires the data to be
untidy, although it does so for a good reason: if you were genuinely
doing a MANOVA, you would *want* your multiple response
variables each in their own column. Doing repeated measures this way
is thinking of your responses at different times like different
variables. 

The approach I've taken in this course is for historical reasons. That
is to say, *my* history, not because the historical perspective
is necessarily the best one.  It began with doing repeated measures in
SAS (this was like nine years ago), and the only way I could get my
head around that was the profile-analysis way. I'm not even sure there
was software for doing mixed models in those days, certainly not in
SAS. Besides, random effects scared me back then. Anyway, when I
moved things over to R (this must have been about six years ago), I
realized I was using basically the same idea in R: make it into a
MANOVA and tweak things as needed. So I developed things by showing
you MANOVA first as ANOVA when you have lots of $y$-variables instead
of just one, and then using it for repeated measures by thinking of
the repeated measures as "different-but-related" $y$-variables. To
my mind, this is a reasonable way of doing it in a course like this:
you get to see MANOVA, which is worth knowing about anyway, and then
you get to apply it to a very common situation.

Mixed models are actually quite recent, as a way of doing this kind of
modelling. Back when I was learning this stuff, you learned to
distinguish between "fixed effects", whose levels were the only ones
you cared about (like the two locations here), and "random effects",
where the ones you observed were only a sample of the ones you might
have seen (like "children" or in general "subjects"). Then you
would test the fixed effects by hypothesizing that their mean effect
was zero and seeing whether you could reject that (in the same way
that you do in regression or regular ANOVA: in the latter case, you
test that the effects of all the different groups are zero, which
comes down to saying that all the groups have the same mean). The way
you handled random effects was to estimate their *variance*, and
then you would test whether a random effect exists or not by testing
whether the variance of that random effect is zero (does not exist) or
is greater than zero. Zero is the smallest a variance (or SD) can be,
which means that testing for it has always been kind of flakey and the
standard theory doesn't work for it (the technical term is 
"on the boundary of the parameter space", and the theory applies when the
null-hypothesis value is strictly *inside* the set of possible
values the parameter can take). Back when we did this stuff by
hand,
`r tufte::margin_note("I understand psychology students *still* do this  kind of stuff by hand.")` we had to figure out whether we were testing
a fixed or a random effect, and there were rules, involving things
called "expected mean squares", that told you how to get the tests
right. Anyway, that is all considered rather old-fashioned now, and
mixed models are where it is at. In these, you typically *only*
test the fixed effects, while estimating the size of the random
effects, taking it for granted that they exist. This is an active area
of research; the things that `lmer` fits are called 
"linear mixed models", and there are also now 
"generalized linear mixed models", things like logistic regression with random effects.

We haven't had to worry about this up to now because in most of the
experimental designs we have used, each subject only contributes
*one*  measurement. In that case, you cannot separate out a
subject-specific "random effect" from random error, and so we lump
it all into random error. The one experimental design where a subject
gives us more than one measurement is matched pairs, and the way we
have handled that so far is to turn the two measurements into one by
taking the difference between them; even in that case, each subject
contributes only one *difference* to the analysis. Repeated
measures, though, is genuinely different: you can't wish away multiple
measurements on the same subject by taking differences any more, so
you have to face up to the issue at last. Either we think of it as
several different measurements that might be correlated (the
profile-analysis MANOVA way), or we face up to the idea that different
subjects bring their own random effect to the table that shows up in
every measurement that the subject provides (mixed models).

I did analysis of covariance as a separate mini-section, thinking of
it as a regression, but if the numerical covariate is the same thing
as the response but measured at a different time (eg., before rather than
after), that would also respond to a repeated-measures approach, or to
the taking of differences as matched pairs does. There is almost
always more than one way to look at these things.
