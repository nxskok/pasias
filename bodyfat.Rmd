##  Measuring body fat


 Athletes are concerned with measuring their body fat
percentage. Two different methods are available: one using ultrasound,
and the other using X-ray technology. We are interested in whether
there is a difference in the mean body fat percentage as measured by
these two methods, and if so, how big that difference is. Data on 16
athletes are at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/bodyfat.txt). 



(a) Explain briefly why a matched pairs analysis is more
suitable for these data than a two-independent-samples analysis
(using a two-sample $t$-test). You might find that looking at the
data (clicking on the link) helps you figure this out.


Solution


The data file looks like this:

```

athlete xray ultrasound
1 5.00 4.75
2 7 3.75
3 9.25 9
4 12 11.75
5 17.25 17
6 29.5 27.5
7 5.5 6.5
8 6 6.75
9 8 8.75
10 8.5 9.5
11 9.25 9.5
12 11 12
13 12 12.25
14 14 15.5
15 17 18
16 18 18.25

```

The data are two measurements for each of the 16 athletes: that
is, each athlete had their body fat percentage measured using
*both* of the two methods. 
Extra: a two-sample $t$ approach would be reasonable if one set of 16
athletes had been measured by X-ray and *another different*
set of 16 athletes had been measured by ultrasound. (That is, if
there had been 32 athletes in total, with each one randomly
assigned to *one* of the measurement methods.) But that's not
what happened. It is easy to measure one athlete's body fat
percentage using both of the two methods, so a matched pairs
design is easy to implement (as well as being better). If you use
two independent samples (each athlete doing only one measurement
method), you introduce an extra source of variability: athletes
differ one from another in body fat, as well as differing possibly
by measurement method. If you use a matched-pairs design, you
remove the athlete-to-athlete differences, leaving only the
differences due to measurement method.

(b) Read in the data and check that you have a sensible number of
rows and columns.



Solution


This kind of thing. Since you looked at the data (didn't you?),
you'll know that the values are separated by single spaces:

```{r }
myurl <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/bodyfat.txt"
bodyfat <- read_delim(myurl, " ")
bodyfat
```

 

16 rows (athletes) and 3 columns, one for each measurement
method and one labelling the athletes. All good.

Since 16 is not too much bigger than 10, I got the whole data frame
here. (At least, I think that's the reason I got more than 10 rows.)
In an R Notebook, you'll see the first ten rows as normal, with a
button to click to see the other six.




$\blacksquare$

(c) Carry out a suitable test to determine whether the means are
the same or different. (At this point, obtain the R output including a P-value.)



Solution


Feed the two columns into `t.test` along with
`paired=T`. This is a two-sided test, so we don't have to
take any special steps for that. Note that we're back to the
"old-fashioned" version of `t.test` that *does not*
allow `data=`, so we have to go the `with` way:

```{r }
with(bodyfat, t.test(xray, ultrasound, paired = T))
```

 



$\blacksquare$

(d) What do you conclude from the test?



Solution


The P-value of 0.7623 is not at all small, so there is no way we can
reject the null hypothesis.^[My hat stays on my head.] There
is no evidence of a difference in means; we can act as if the two
methods produce the same mean body fat percentage. 
That is to say, on this evidence we can use either method, whichever
one is cheaper or more convenient.




$\blacksquare$

(e) Obtain a 95\% confidence interval for the population mean
difference. How is the interval consistent with your test?



Solution


You don't even need to do any more coding: the test was two-sided,
so just pick the confidence interval off the output above: $-0.74$
to 0.56. 
The interval includes both positive and negative values (or, 0 is
inside the interval), so the difference could go either way. This is
entirely consistent with not being able to reject the null.



$\blacksquare$

(f) Calculate the differences, and make a normal quantile plot of
them. Is there any evidence that normality of differences fails?
Explain briefly. 



Solution


The smoothest^[I learned yesterday that the Welsh word for "ironing" is *smwddio*, which seems weird until you say    it out loud: it sounds like "smoothio".] 
way to do this is to
use a pipeline: use a `mutate` to create the column of
differences, and then pipe that into `ggplot`, omitting the
data frame that would normally go first (the input data frame here
is the new one with the differences in it, which doesn't have a
name). I'll make a normal quantile plot in a moment, but if you
haven't seen that yet, the plot to make is a histogram:
```{r }
bodyfat %>%
  mutate(diff = xray - ultrasound) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = diff)) + geom_histogram(bins = 6)
```

   

I don't know whether you'd call that "approximately normal" or
not. We are in kind of a double-bind with this one: the sample size is
small, so normality matters, but with a small sample, the data might
not look very normal. It's kind of skewed right, but most of the
evidence for the skewness is contained in those two observations with
difference 2 and above, which is pretty flimsy evidence for
anything. (In the normal quantile plot below, the suggestion is that
those two observations really are a bit too large. It's easier to tell
there.) 

Below, I'm repeating the calculation of the differences, which is
inefficient. If I'm going to draw two graphs of the differences, the
right way is to calculate the differences *and save the data
frame*, then use that new data frame twice. But you're probably only
going to draw either the histogram or the normal quantile plot, not
both, so you can use the appropriate one of my two bits of code. The
normal quantile plot:
```{r }
bodyfat %>%
  mutate(diff = xray - ultrasound) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = diff)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```

   
This is showing a little evidence of skewness or outliers  (depending
on your point of view: either is good). The lowest and highest values
are both too high, and the pattern of points on the plot is kind of
curved (which would be evidence of skewness). Or you could say that
the two highest values are too high, with the other values being more
or less in line (that would be evidence of outliers at the upper
end). I like outliers better than skewness, since those bottom-end
points are not far off the line. I would also accept 
"no substantial problems", 
if you can make the case that those two highest points are
not too far off the line. With only 16 observations as we have here,
even truly normal data would stray off the line a bit.

As ever, your explanation is more important than your conclusion. Can
you justify what you think?

If you took your differences the other way around, as
`ultrasound` minus `xray`, your plot will also be the
other way around, with the "outliers" at the bottom. That's good
too.

Where this is going (which I didn't ask you) is whether or not we
trust the result of the matched pairs test. I would say that the test
is so far from being significant, and the failure of normality is not
gross, that it is hard to imagine *any* alternative test coming
up with a significant result. So I would be happy to trust this paired
$t$-test.

$\blacksquare$
