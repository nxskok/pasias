##  Body fat revisited


 Athletes are concerned with measuring their body fat
percentage. Two different methods are available: one using ultrasound,
and the other using X-ray technology. We are interested in whether
there is a difference in the mean body fat percentage as measured by
these two methods, and if so, how big that difference is. Data on 16
athletes are at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/bodyfat.txt). 

We saw this data set before.




(a) Read in the data again.




(b) Calculate the differences, and make a normal quantile plot of
them. Is there any evidence that normality of differences fails?
Explain briefly. 




(c) Previously, we did a matched-pairs $t$-test for these data. In
the light of your normal quantile plot, do you think that was a good
idea? Explain briefly.




(d) Use the sign test appropriately to compare the two methods for
measuring body fat. (Use `smmr` if you wish.) What do you
conclude, as ever in the context of the data?
