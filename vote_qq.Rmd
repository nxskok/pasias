##  Predicting voting


 1257 British voters were classified according
to their social class, age (categorized), sex and the political party
they voted for (Labour or Conservative). Which, if any, of these
factors influences the party that someone votes for? The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/voting.txt), one voter
per line.



(a) Read in the data and display (some of) the data frame.


(b) There is no frequency column here, because each row of the
data frame only represents one voter. Count up the frequencies for
each combo of the categorical variables, and save it (this is the
data frame that we will use for the analysis).
Display the first few rows of the result. Do you now
have something that you need?


(c) Fit a log-linear model with the appropriate interaction (as a
starting point).


(d) Refine your model by taking out suitable non-significant
terms, in multiple steps. What model do you finish with?


(e) If we think of the party someone votes for as the final
outcome (that depends on all the other things), what does our final
model say that someone's vote depends on?


(f) Obtain sub-tables that explain how `vote` depends on
any of the things it's related to.
