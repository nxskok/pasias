##  Growing corn


 A new type of corn seed has been developed.
The people developing it want to know if the type of soil the seed
is planted in has an impact on how well the seed performs, and if so,
what kind of impact. Three
outcome measures were used: the yield of corn produced (from a fixed
amount of seed), the amount of water needed, and the amount of
herbicide needed. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/cornseed.csv). 32 fields
were planted with the seed, 8 fields with each soil type.



(a) Read in the data and verify that you have 32 observations
with the correct variables.



(b) Run a multivariate analysis of variance to see whether
the type of soil has any effect on any of the variables. What do you
conclude from it?



(c) Run a discriminant analysis on these data, "predicting"
soil type from the three response variables. Display the results.



(d) <a name="part:corn-svd">*</a> 
Which linear discriminants seem to be worth paying attention to?
Why did you get three linear discriminants? Explain briefly.



(e) Which response variables do the important linear
discriminants depend on? Answer this by extracting something from
your discriminant analysis output.



(f) Obtain predictions for the discriminant analysis. (You
don't need to do anything with them yet.)



(g) Plot the first two discriminant scores against each other,
coloured by soil type. You'll have to start by making a data frame
containing what you need.



(h) On your plot that you just made, explain briefly how `LD1`
distinguishes at least one of the soil types.




(i) On your plot, does `LD2` appear to do anything to
separate the groups? Is this surprising given your earlier findings?
Explain briefly.




(j) Make a table of actual and predicted `soil`
group. Which soil type was classified correctly the most often?
