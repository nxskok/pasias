##  Mental context


 It is believed that being in the same mental context for
learning and for testing leads to better test scores. An experiment
was carried out to test this. During the learning phase, subjects
learned a list of 80 words in a room painted orange and decorated with
posters, paintings and other paraphernalia.^[This is a fancy  word for *stuff*.] A memory test was given to all subjects
immediately after they had learned the words, to give the impression
that the experiment was over. (The results of this test were
discarded.) One day later, subjects were unexpectedly re-tested under
different experimental conditions and asked to write down all the
words of the original list that they could remember. The re-test took
place in five different conditions, which subjects were randomly
allocated to one of:



* Same context: in the original orange-painted room.

* Different context: in a very different room, painted grey and
located in a different part of campus.

* Imaginary context: in the grey room, but subjects are asked to
remember the orange room in which they took the original test. To
help them with this, the experimenter begins by asking them several
questions about the orange room and the objects in it.

* Photographed context: in the grey room, but subjects are shown
photographs of the orange room.

* Placebo context: in the grey room, with subjects first being
asked to recall their living room.


In each case, the response variable was the number of words on the
original list successfully recalled by each subject.

50 subjects in total completed the experiment, 10 under each of the 5
conditions. 

The researchers had four research hypotheses to test with the data:



* Groups where the context matches (is the same, or is simulated
by imagining or photograph) will perform better than groups with
different or placebo contexts.

* The group with the same context will differ from the group with
imaginary or photographed contexts.


* The imaginary-context group will differ from the
photographed-context group.

* The different-context group will differ from the placebo-context group.


The research hypotheses are (as is usual) written as
*alternative* hypotheses. We can rewrite them as null
hypotheses, with some extra wording to facilitate converting them
into contrasts, like this:


* The mean of the `same`, `imaginary` and
`photograph` groups (group means) is equal to the mean of the
`different` and `placebo` groups (group means).

* The mean of the `imaginary` and `photograph`
groups is equal to the (mean of the) `same` group.

* The `imaginary` and the `photograph` groups will
have the same mean.

* The `different` and the `placebo` groups will
have the same mean.

The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/smith.txt) (the
original researcher's name was Smith). 


(a) Read in the data and verify that you have a column called
`context` that is text and a column called
`words` that is a (whole) number.



(b) Turn `context` into a `factor`, within the
data frame. (We are going to be doing contrasts). Display how the
data frame now looks.



(c) What are the names of the five contexts in the data set
(just display them),
and what order are they in?



(d) Write each of the four research hypotheses (in the
null-hypothesis versions) as R vectors that can be used to make
contrasts. (This will mean getting the contexts in the right
order. If you get stuck, do the last two first, since they're
easiest. The first one is actually the hardest.)



(e) Pick two of your contrasts (doesn't matter which two) and
demonstrate that they are orthogonal.



(f) Collect your contrasts together into a matrix, and
tell `lm` that these are the contrasts for `context`.



(g) Fit a model with `lm`, and display the results.



(h) For each of the original research hypotheses, what do you
infer about them?
