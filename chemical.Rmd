##  Handling shipments of chemicals


 The data in
[link](http://statweb.lsu.edu/EXSTWeb/StatLab/DataSets/NKNWData/CH06PR09.txt)
are on shipments of chemicals in drums that arrive at a warehouse. In
order, the variables are:


* the number of minutes required to handle the shipment

* the number of drums in the shipment

* the total weight of the shipment, in hundreds of pounds.




(a) The data set has two features: *no* column names, and
data aligned in columns (that is, more than one space between data
values). Read the data in, giving the columns suitable names. To do
this, you may have to consult an appropriate help file, or do some
searching, perhaps of one of the other questions on this assignment.


Solution


The alignment of columns means that we need to use
`read_table`. Once you've figured *that* out, you can
search for help by typing `?read_table` in the Console
window (the help will appear bottom right), or you can put the
same thing into an R Notebook code chunk, and when you run the
chunk, the help will be displayed. (Press control-shift-1 to go
back to the notebook.)
Or you can Google it, of course.
The key observation is that you need to supply some column names
in `col_names`, like this:
```{r chemical-1 }
my_url <- "http://statweb.lsu.edu/EXSTWeb/StatLab/DataSets/NKNWData/CH06PR09.txt"
cols <- c("minutes", "drums", "weight")
chemicals <- read_table(my_url, col_names = cols)
chemicals
```

     

I like to define my URL and column names up front. You can define
either of them in the `read_table`, but it makes that line
longer. Up to you.

There is no `skip` here, because the data file starts right
away with the data and we want to use all the values: we are
*adding* names to what's in the data file. If you used
`skip`, you will be one observation short all the way through,
and your output will be slightly different from mine all the way
through.

Use any names you like, but they should resemble what the columns
actually represent.

(b) Fit a regression predicting the number of minutes required
to handle a shipment from the other two variables. Display the results.


Solution


```{r chemical-2 }
minutes.1 <- lm(minutes ~ drums + weight, data = chemicals)
summary(minutes.1)
```

     
    
$\blacksquare$

(c) Explain carefully but briefly what the slope coefficients
for the two explanatory variables represent. Do their signs
(positive or negative) make practical sense in the context of
handling shipments of chemicals?


Solution


The slope coefficient for `drums` is 3.77; this means that
a shipment with one extra drum (but the same total weight) would
take on average 3.77 minutes longer to handle. Likewise, the slope
coefficient for `weight` is 5.08, so a shipment that
weighs 1 hundred more pounds but has the same number of drums
will take 5.08 more minutes to handle.
Or "each additional drum, all else equal, will take 3.77 more minutes to handle", or similar wording. You have to get at two
things: a one-unit increase in the explanatory variable going with
a certain increase in the response, and *also* the "all else    equal" part. How you say it is up to you, but you need to say it.
That was two marks. The third one comes from noting that both
slope coefficients are positive, so making a shipment either
contain more drums or weigh more makes the handling time longer as
well. This makes perfect sense, since either kind of increase
would make the shipment more difficult to handle, and thus take
longer. 
I was *not* asking about P-values. There isn't really much to
say about those: they're both significant, so the handling time
depends on both the total weight and the number of drums. Removing
either from the regression would be a mistake.

(d) Obtain plots of residuals against fitted values, residuals
against explanatory variables, and a normal quantile plot of the residuals.


Solution


These are the standard plots from a multiple regression. The
second one requires care, but the first and last should be straightforward.
Residuals against fitted values:
```{r chemical-3 }
ggplot(minutes.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

     

The tricky part about the second one is that the $x$-values and the
residuals come from different data frames, which has to get expressed
in the `ggplot`. The obvious way is to do the two plots (one
for each explanatory variable) one at a time:

```{r chemical-4 }
ggplot(minutes.1, aes(x = chemicals$drums, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

 

and 

```{r chemical-5 }
ggplot(minutes.1, aes(x = chemicals$weight, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

 
What would also work is to make a data frame first with the things to plot:

```{r chemical-6 }
dd <- tibble(weight = chemicals$weight, drums = chemicals$drums, res = resid(minutes.1))
```

 

and then:

```{r chemical-7 }
ggplot(dd, aes(x = weight, y = res)) + geom_point()
```

 

and similarly for `drums`. The `resid` with the model
name in brackets seems to be necessary.

Another way to approach this is `augment` from
`broom`. That does this:

```{r chemical-8 }
library(broom)
d <- minutes.1 %>% augment(chemicals)
as_tibble(d)
```

 

and then you can use `d` as the "base" data frame from which
everything comes:

```{r chemical-9 }
ggplot(d, aes(x = drums, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

 

and

```{r chemical-10 }
ggplot(d, aes(x = weight, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

 

or you can even do that trick to put the two plots on facets:

```{r chemical-11 }
d %>%
  pivot_longer(drums:weight, names_to="xname", values_to="x") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = .resid)) + geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~xname)
```

 

Last, the normal quantile plot:

```{r chemical-12 }
ggplot(minutes.1, aes(sample = .resid)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```

 

As a check for the grader, there should be four plots, obtained
somehow: residuals against fitted values, normal quantile plot of
residuals, residuals against `drums`, residuals against  
`weight`.

(e) Do you have any concerns, looking at the residual plots?
Explain briefly.


Solution


The (only) concern I have, looking at those four plots, is the one very
positive residual, the one around 15. Take that away, and I think
all of the plots are then acceptable. 
Alternatively, I will take something like "I have no concerns    about the form of the relationship", saying that the *kind*
of model being fitted here is OK (no evidence of non-linearity,
fanning out, that kind of stuff). It's up to you to decide whether
you think "concerns" extends to outliers, high-influence points,
etc. 
The normal quantile plot reveals that the most negative residual,
the one around $-9$, is in fact almost exactly as negative as you
would expect the most negative residual to be, so it is not an
outlier at all. The residuals are almost exactly normally
distributed, *except* for the most positive one.
I don't think you can justify fanning-in, since the evidence for
that is mostly from the single point on the right. The other
points do not really have residuals closer to zero as you move
left to right.

Do *not* be tempted to pick out everything you can think of wrong
with these plots. The grader can, and will, take away points if you
start naming things that are not concerns.

Extra: what else can I find out about that large-positive-residual
point? This is where having the "augmented" data frame is a plus:

```{r chemical-13 }
d %>% filter(.resid > 10)
```

 

As shown. The predicted number of minutes is 96.8, but the actual
number of minutes it took is 112. Hence the residual of 15.2. 
Can we find "similar" numbers of `drums` and
`weight` and compare the `minutes`? Try this:

```{r chemical-14 }
chemicals %>% filter(
  between(weight, 8, 11),
  between(drums, 10, 14)
)
```

 

You might not have seen `between` before, but it works the way
you'd expect.^[Weight between 8 and 11, for example,  returning `TRUE` or `FALSE`.] Two other shipments with similar numbers of drums and
total weight took around 90--100 minutes to handle, so the 112 does
look about 15 minutes too long. This was actually an average-sized shipment:

```{r chemical-15 }
library(ggrepel)
d %>%
  mutate(my_label = ifelse(.resid > 10, "residual +", "")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = drums, y = weight, colour = minutes, label = my_label)) +
  geom_point() + geom_text_repel()
```

 

so it's a bit of a mystery why it took so long to handle. 

I had some fun with the graph: if you set `colour` equal to a
continuous variable (as `minutes` is here), you get a
continuous colour scale, by default from dark blue (small) to light
blue (large). The number of minutes tends to get larger (lighter) as
you go up and to the right with bigger shipments. The point labelled
"residual +" is the one with the large residual; it is a
noticeably lighter blue than the points around it, meaning that it
took longer to handle than those points. I used the trick from C32 to
label "some" (here one) of the points: create a new label variable
with a `mutate` and an `ifelse`, leaving all of the
other labels blank so you don't see them.

The blue colour scheme is a little hard to judge values on. Here's
another way to do that:

```{r chemical-16 }
d %>%
  mutate(my_label = ifelse(.resid > 10, "residual +", "")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = drums, y = weight, colour = minutes, label = my_label)) +
  geom_point() + geom_text_repel() +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "red", high = "blue")
```

 

The labelled point is a little more blue (purplish) than the more
clearly red points near it.

The other thing to see is that there is also a positive correlation
between the number of drums and the total weight, which is what you'd
expect. Unlike with some of our other examples, this wasn't strong
enough to cause problems; the separate effects of `drums` and
`weight` on `minutes` were distinguishable enough to
allow both explanatory variables to have a strongly significant effect
on `minutes`.

Post scriptum: the "drums" here are not concert-band-type drums, but
something like this:
