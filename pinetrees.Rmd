##  Predicting volume of wood in pine trees


 In forestry, the financial value of a tree
is the volume of wood that it contains. This is difficult to estimate
while the tree is still standing, but the diameter is easy to measure
with a tape measure (to measure the circumference) and a calculation
involving $\pi$, assuming that the cross-section of the tree is at
least approximately circular.  The standard measurement is
"diameter at breast height" 
(that is, at the height of a human breast or
chest), defined as being 4.5 feet above the ground.

Several pine trees had their diameter measured shortly before being
cut down, and for each tree, the volume of wood was recorded. The data
are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/pinetrees.txt). The
diameter is in inches and the volume is in cubic inches.  Is it
possible to predict the volume of wood from the diameter?



(a) Read the data into R and display the values (there are not
very many).


Solution


Observe that the data values are separated by spaces, and therefore
that `read_delim` will do it:
```{r }
my_url <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/pinetrees.txt"
trees <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
trees
```

    

That looks like the data file.



(b) Make a suitable plot.


Solution


No clues this time. You need to recognize that you have two
quantitative variables, so that a scatterplot is called
for. Also, the volume is the response, so that should go on the $y$-axis:
```{r }
ggplot(trees, aes(x = diameter, y = volume)) + geom_point()
```

       

You can put a smooth trend on it if you like, which would
look like this:

```{r }
ggplot(trees, aes(x = diameter, y = volume)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

       

I'll take either of those for this part, though I think the smooth
trend actually obscures the issue here (because there is not so much
data). 

 

(c) Describe what you learn from your plot about the
relationship between diameter and volume, if anything.


Solution


The word "relationship" offers a clue that a scatterplot would
have been a good idea, if you hadn't realized by now. 
I am guided by "form, direction, strength" in looking at a scatterplot:


* Form: it is an apparently linear relationship.

* Direction: it is an upward trend: that is, a tree with a larger diameter also has a larger volume of wood. (This is not very surprising.)

* Strength:  I'd call this a strong (or moderate-to-strong) relationship. (We'll see in a minute what the R-squared is.)

You don't need to be as formal as this, but you *do* need
to get at the idea that it is an upward trend, apparently
linear, and at least fairly strong.

(d) Fit a (linear) regression, predicting volume from diameter,
and obtain the `summary`. How would you describe the R-squared?


Solution


My naming convention is (usually) to call the fitted model
object by the name of the response variable and a number. (I
have always used dots, but in the spirit of the
`tidyverse` I suppose I should use underscores.)
```{r }
volume.1 <- lm(volume ~ diameter, data = trees)
summary(volume.1)
```

       

R-squared is nearly 96\%, so the relationship is definitely a strong one.

I also wanted to mention the `broom` package, which was
installed with the `tidyverse` but which you need to load
separately. It provides two handy ways to summarize a fitted model
(regression, analysis of variance or whatever):

```{r }
library(broom)
glance(volume.1)
```

 

This gives a one-line summary of a model, including things like
R-squared. This is handy if you're fitting more than one model,
because you can collect the one-line summaries together into a data
frame and eyeball them.

The other summary is this one:

```{r }
tidy(volume.1)
```

 

This gives a table of intercepts, slopes and their P-values, but the
value to this one is that it is a *data frame*, so if you want to
pull anything out of it, you know how to do that:
`r tufte::margin_note("The  *summary* output is more designed for looking at than for  extracting things from.")`
```{r }
tidy(volume.1) %>% filter(term == "diameter")
```

 

This gets the estimated slope and its P-value, without worrying about
the corresponding things for the intercept, which are usually of less
interest anyway.



(e) Draw a graph that will help you decide whether you trust
the linearity of this regression. What do you conclude? Explain briefly.


Solution


The thing I'm fishing for is a residual plot (of the residuals
against the fitted values), and on it you are looking for a
random mess of nothingness:
```{r }
ggplot(volume.1, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

       

Make a call. You could say that there's no discernible pattern,
especially with such a small data set, and
therefore that the regression is fine. Or you could say that there is
fanning-in: the two points on the right have residuals close to 0
while the points on the left have residuals larger in size. Say
something. 

I don't think you can justify a curve or a trend, because
the residuals on the left are both positive and negative.

My feeling is that the residuals on the right are close to 0 because
these points have noticeably larger diameter than the others, and they
are *influential* points in the regression that will pull the
line closer to themselves. This is why their residuals are close to
zero. But I am happy with either of the points made in the paragraph
under the plot.



(f) What would you guess would be the volume of a tree of
diameter zero? Is that what the regression predicts? Explain briefly.


Solution


Logically, a tree that has diameter zero is a non-existent tree,
so its volume should be zero as well. 
In the regression, the quantity that says what volume is when
diameter is zero is the *intercept*. Here the intercept is
$-192$, which is definitely not zero. In fact, if you look at
the P-value, the intercept is significantly *less* than
zero. Thus, the model makes no logical sense for trees of small
diameter. The smallest tree in the data set has diameter 18,
which is not really small, I suppose, but it is a little
disconcerting to have a model that makes no logical sense.

 

(g) A simple way of modelling a tree's shape is to pretend it is a
cone, like this, but probably taller and skinnier:


![](/home/ken/Pictures/conebnw.png)
        

with its base on the ground. What is the relationship between the
*diameter* (at the base) and volume of a cone? (If you don't
remember, look it up. You'll probably get a formula in terms of the
radius, which you'll have to convert.
Cite the website you used.)


Solution


According to
[link](http://www.web-formulas.com/Math_Formulas/Geometry_Volume_of_Cone.aspx),
the volume of a cone is $V=\pi r^2h/3$, where $V$ is the volume,
$r$ is the radius (at the bottom of the cone) and $h$ is the
height. The diameter is twice the radius, so replace $r$ by
$d/2$, $d$ being the diameter. A little algebra gives 
$$ V = \pi d^2 h / 12.$$

 

(h) Fit a regression model that predicts volume from diameter
according to the formula you obtained in the previous part. You can
assume that the trees in this data set are of similar heights, so
that the height can be treated as a constant.  
Display the
results.


Solution


According to my formula, the volume depends on the diameter
squared, which I include in the model thus:
```{r }
volume.2 <- lm(volume ~ I(diameter^2), data = trees)
summary(volume.2)
```

       

This adds an intercept as well, which is fine (there are technical
difficulties around removing the intercept).

That's as far as I wanted you to go, but (of course) I have a few
comments.

The intercept here is still negative, but not significantly different
from zero, which is a step forward. The R-squared for this regression
is very similar to that from our linear model (the one for which the
intercept made no sense). So, from that point of view, either model
predicts the data well. I should look at the residuals from this one:

```{r }
ggplot(volume.2, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

 

I really don't think there are any problems there.

Now, I said to assume that the trees are all of similar height. This
seems entirely questionable, since the trees vary quite a bit in
diameter, and you would guess that trees with bigger diameter would
also be taller. It seems more plausible that the same kind of trees
(pine trees in this case) would have the same "shape", so that if
you knew the diameter you could *predict* the height, with
larger-diameter trees being taller. Except that we don't have the
heights here, so we can't build a model for that.

So I went looking in the literature. I found this paper:
[link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5497/3d02d63428e3dfed6645acfdba874ad80822.pdf). This
gives several models for relationships between volume, diameter and height. In
the formulas below, there is an implied "plus error" on the right,
and the $\alpha_i$ are parameters to be estimated.

For predicting height from diameter (equation 1 in paper):

$$  h = \exp(\alpha_1+\alpha_2 d^{\alpha_3}) $$

For predicting volume from height and diameter (equation 6):

$$  V = \alpha_1 d^{\alpha_2} h^{\alpha_3} $$

This is a take-off on our assumption that the trees were cone-shaped,
with cone-shaped trees having $\alpha_1=\pi/12$, $\alpha_2=2$ and
$\alpha_3=1$. The paper uses different units, so $\alpha_1$ is not
comparable, but $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ are (as estimated from the
data in the paper, which were for longleaf pine) quite close to 2 and
1.

Last, the actual relationship that helps us: predicting volume from
just diameter (equation 5):

$$  V = \alpha_1 d^{\alpha_2}$$

This is a power law type of relationship. For example, if you were
willing to pretend that a tree was a cone with height proportional to
diameter (one way of getting at the idea of a bigger tree typically
being taller, instead of assuming constant height as we did), that
would imply $\alpha_2=3$ here.

This is non-linear as it stands, but we can bash it into shape by taking
logs:

$$
\ln V = \ln \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \ln d
$$

so that log-volume has a linear relationship with log-diameter and we
can go ahead and estimate it:

```{r }
volume.3 <- lm(log(volume) ~ log(diameter), data = trees)
summary(volume.3)
```

 

The parameter that I called $\alpha_2$ above is the slope of this
model, 3.13. This is a bit different from the figure in the paper,
which was 2.19. I think these are comparable even though the other
parameter is not (again, measurements in different units, plus, this
time we need to take the log of it). I think the "slopes" are
comparable because we haven't estimated our slope all that accurately:

```{r }
confint(volume.3)
```

 

From 2.3 to 3.9. It is definitely not zero, but we are rather less
sure about what it is, and 2.19 is not completely implausible.

The R-squared here, though it is less than the other ones we
got, is still high. The residuals are these:

```{r }
ggplot(volume.3, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + geom_point()
```

 

which again seem to show no problems. The residuals are smaller in
size now because of the log transformation: the actual and predicted
log-volumes are smaller numbers than the actual and predicted volumes,
so the residuals are now closer to zero.

Does this model behave itself at zero? Well, roughly at least: if the
diameter is very small, its log is very negative, and the predicted
log-volume is also very negative (the slope is positive). So the
predicted actual volume will be close to zero. If you want to make
that mathematically rigorous, you can take limits, but that's the
intuition. We can also do some predictions: set up a data frame that has a column called `diameter` with some diameters to predict for:

```{r }
d <- tibble(diameter = c(1, 2, seq(5, 50, 5)))
d
```



and then feed that into `predict`:

```{r }
p <- predict(volume.3, d)
d %>% mutate(pred = p)
```



These are predicted log-volumes, so we'd better anti-log them. `log` in R is natural logs, so this is inverted using `exp`: 

```{r }
d %>% mutate(pred = exp(p))
```



For a diameter near zero, the predicted volume appears to be near zero as well.

<br>

I mentioned `broom` earlier. We can make a data frame out of
the one-line summaries of our three models:

```{r }
bind_rows(glance(volume.1), glance(volume.2), glance(volume.3))
```

 

(I mistakenly put `glimpse` instead of `glance` there
the first time. The former is for a quick look at a *data frame*,
while the latter is for a quick look at a *model*.)

The three R-squareds are all high, with the one from the third model
being a bit lower as we saw before. 

My code is rather repetitious. There has to be a way to streamline
it. I was determined to find out how. My solution involves putting the
three models in a list-column, and then using `rowwise` to
get the `glance` output for each one.

```{r}
tibble(i = 1:3, model = list(volume.1, volume.2, volume.3)) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(glances = list(glance(model))) %>% 
  unnest(glances)
```

I almost got caught by forgetting the `list` on the definition of `glances`. I certainly need it, because the output from `glance` is a (one-row) dataframe, not a single number.

It works. You see the three R-squared values in the first column of numbers. The
third model is otherwise a lot different from the others because it
has a different response variable.

Other thoughts:

How might you measure or estimate the height of a
tree (other than by climbing it and dropping a tape measure down)? One
way, that works if the tree is fairly isolated, is to walk away from
its base. Periodically, you point at the top of the tree, and when the
angle between your arm and the ground reaches 45 degrees, you stop
walking. (If it's greater than 45 degrees, you walk further away, and
if it's less, you walk back towards the tree.) The distance between
you and the base of the tree is then equal to the height of the tree,
and if you have a long enough tape measure you can measure it.

The above works because the tangent of 45 degrees is 1. If you have a
device that will measure the actual angle,
`r tufte::margin_note("These days, there  are apps that will let you do this with your phone. I found one called Clinometer. See also [link](https://gabrielhemery.com/how-to-calculate-tree-height-using-a-smartphone/).")` 
you
can be any distance away from the tree, point the device at the top,
record the angle, and do some trigonometry to estimate the height of
the tree (to which you add the height of your eyes).
