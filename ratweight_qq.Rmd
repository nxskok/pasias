##  Effect of drug on rat weight


 Box (1950) gives data on the weights of three groups of
rats. One group was given thyroxin in their drinking water, one group
thiouracil, and the third group was a control. (This description comes
from Christensen (2001).)^[References: Box, George EP, Problems in the analysis of growth and wear curves, Biometrics vol. 6, 362-369, 1950; Christensen R, Advanced Linear Modeling, 2nd edition, Springer, 2001. Yes, that's the Box-Cox Box.]
Weights are measured in
grams at weekly intervals (over a 4-week period, so that each rat is
measured 5 times). The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ratweight.csv) as a
`.csv` file.



(a) Read in the data and check that you have a column of
`drug` and five columns of rat weights at different times.
 

(b) Why would it be *wrong* to use something like
`pivot_longer` to create one column of weights, and separate
columns of drug and time, and then to run a two-way ANOVA? Explain briefly.
 

(c) Create a suitable response variable and fit a suitable
`lm` as the first step of the repeated-measures analysis.
 

(d) Load the package `car` and run a suitable
`Manova`. To do this, you will need to set up the right thing
for `idata` and `idesign`.
 

(e) Take a look at the output from the MANOVA. Is there a
significant interaction? What does its significance (or lack
thereof) mean?
 

(f) We are going to draw an interaction plot in a moment. To
set that up, use `pivot_longer` as in the lecture notes to create
one column of weights and a second column of times. (You don't
need to do the `separate` thing that I did in class, though
if you want to try it, go ahead.)
 

(g) Obtain an interaction plot. Putting `time` as the
`x` will put time along the horizontal axis, which is the
way we're used to seeing such things. Begin by calculating the mean
`weight` for each `time`-`drug` combination.
 

(h) How does this plot show why the interaction was
significant? Explain briefly.
