##  Throwing baseballs and softballs


 Can students throw a baseball farther than a softball? A
statistics class, containing 24 students, went out to a football field
to try to answer this question. Each student warmed up and then threw
each type of ball as far as they could. The order of ball types was
randomized: some students threw the baseball first, and some threw the
softball first. (A softball is bigger than a baseball, so we might
expect that a softball would be harder to throw a long way than a
baseball.) The data are in
[http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/throw.txt](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/throw.txt) in three
columns: the first is a number identifying the student, the second is
the distance thrown with the baseball (in yards) and the third is the
distance thrown with the softball (also in yards).



(a) Read the data into R. You'll need to supply some names
to the columns.



(b) Calculate a column of differences, baseball minus softball,
*in* the data frame.



(c) Carry out a sign test in R, testing the null hypothesis
that the median difference is zero, against the alternative that
it is greater than zero. Obtain a P-value. Your option whether you use
`smmr` or not.
