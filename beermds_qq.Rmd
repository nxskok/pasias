##  More beer please


 Previously, you did a cluster analysis of
ten brands of beer, as rated by 32 students. This time, we will do a
non-metric multidimensional scaling of those same brands of beer. The
data are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/beer.txt).



(a) Noting that we want to assess distances between brands of beer,
read in the data and do whatever you need to do to work out
distances between the beers. Show your result.
 

(b) Obtain a non-metric multidimensional scaling of the
beers. (Comment coming up in a moment.)
 

(c) Obtain the `stress` value of the map, and comment on it.
 

(d) Obtain a map of the beers, labelled with the names of the
beers. 
 

(e) Find a pair of beers close together on your map. Are they
similar in terms of student ratings? Explain briefly.
 

(f) In our cluster analysis, we found that Anchor Steam, Pete's
Wicked Ale, Guinness and Sierra Nevada were all in the same
cluster. Would you expect them to be close together on your map? Are
they? Explain briefly.
