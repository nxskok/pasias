##  Fear of math


 Two new short courses have been proposed for helping
students who suffer from severe math phobia. The courses are labelled
A and B. Ten students were randomly allocated to one of these two
courses, and each student's score on a math phobia test was recorded
after they completed their course. The math phobia test produces
whole-number scores between 0 and 10, with a higher score indicating a
greater fear of mathematics. The data can be found in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/mathphobia.txt). We start
with R for this question.



(a) Read in the data and check, however you like, that you have 10
observations, 5 from each course.



(b) Do a two-sample $t$-test to assess whether there is a
difference in mean phobia scores after the students have taken the two
courses. What do you conclude? (You have no \textsl{a
priori}^[That is, before looking at the data. This is  Latin. It's also the place that the Bayesian "prior distribution"  comes from. The "posterior distribution" comes from the Latin  *a posteriori*, which means *afterwards*, that is, after  you have looked at the data.] 
reason to
suppose that a particular one of the tests will produce a higher mean
than the other, so do a two-sided test.)




(c) Draw boxplots of the math phobia scores for each group (one
line of code). What is the most striking thing that you notice?




(d) Explain briefly why a $t$-test would not be good for these
data. (There are two things that you need to say.)




(e) Run a suitable test to compare the "typical" scores for the
two courses. (You can use the version from a package rather than
building your own.) What do you conclude?
