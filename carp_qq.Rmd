##  Endogenous nitrogen excretion in carp


 A paper in Fisheries Science reported on variables that
affect "endogenous nitrogen excretion" or ENE in carp raised in
Japan. A number of carp were divided into groups based on body weight,
and each group was placed in a different tank. The mean body weight of
the carp placed in each tank was recorded. The carp were then fed a
protein-free diet three times daily for a period of 20 days. At the
end of the experiment, the amount of ENE in each tank was measured, in
milligrams of total fish body weight per day. (Thus it should not
matter that some of the tanks had more fish than others, because the
scaling is done properly.)

For this question, write a report in R Markdown that answers the
questions below and contains some narrative that describes your
analysis. Create an HTML document from your R Markdown.



(a) Read the data in from
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/carp.txt). There are 10
tanks. 




(b) Create a scatterplot of ENE (response) against bodyweight
(explanatory). Add a smooth trend to your plot.



(c) Is there an upward or downward trend (or neither)? Is the
relationship a line or a curve? Explain briefly.



(d) Fit a straight line to the data, and obtain the R-squared
for the regression.



(e) Obtain a residual plot (residuals against fitted values)
for this regression. Do you see any problems? If so, what does that
tell you about the relationship in the data?



(f) Fit a parabola to the data (that is, including an
$x$-squared term). Compare the R-squared values for the models in
this part and part (d). Does that suggest that the parabola
model is an improvement here over the linear model?



(g) Is the test for the slope coefficient for the squared term
significant? What does this mean?



(h) Make the scatterplot of part (b), but add
the fitted curve. Describe any way in which the curve fails to fit well.



(i) Obtain a residual plot for the parabola model. Do you see
any problems with it? (If you do, I'm not asking you to do anything
about them in this question, but I will.)
