##  Atomic weight of carbon


 The atomic weight of the chemical element
carbon is 12. Two methods of measuring the atomic weight of samples of
carbon were compared. The results are shown in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/carbon.txt). The methods
are labelled 1 and 2.  The first task is to find out whether the two
methods have different "typical" measures (mean or median, as
appropriate) of the atomic weight of carbon.

For this question, compose a report in R Markdown.  (R Markdown is
what you use in an R Notebook, but you can also have a separate R
Markdown document from which you can produce HTML, Word etc. output.)
See part (a) for how to get this started.

Your report should
read like an actual report, not just the answers to some questions
that I set you. To help with that, write some text that links the
parts of the report together smoothly, so that it reads as a coherent
whole. The grader had 3 discretionary marks to award for the overall
quality of your writing. The scale for this was:



* 3 points: excellent writing. The report flows smoothly, is easy
to read, and contains everything it should (and nothing it
shouldn't).

* 2 points: satisfactory writing. Not the easiest to read, but
says what it should, and it looks at least somewhat like a report
rather than a string of answers to questions.

* 1 point: writing that is hard to read or to understand. If you
get this (or 0), you should consider what you need to do to improve
when you write your project.

* 0 points: you answered the questions, but you did almost nothing
to make it read like a report.



(a) Create a new R Markdown document. To do this, in R Studio, select File,
New File, R Markdown. Type the report title and your name in the
boxes, and leave the output on the default HTML. Click OK. 


(b) Write an introduction that explains the purpose of this
study and the data collected in your own words.



(c) Begin an appropriately-titled new section in your report,
read the data into R and display the results.



(d) Make an appropriate plot to compare the measurements
obtained by the two methods. You might need to do something about
the two methods being given as numbers even though they are really
only identifiers. (If you do, your report ought to say what you did
and why.)



(e) Comment briefly on what you see in your plot.



(f) Carry out the most appropriate $t$-test. (You might like to
begin another new section in your report here.)



(g) Do the most appropriate test you know that does not assume
normally-distributed data.



(h) Discuss the results of your tests and what they say about
the two methods for measuring the atomic weight of carbon. If it
seems appropriate, put the discussion into a section called
Conclusions.
