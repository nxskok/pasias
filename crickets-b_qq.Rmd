##  Crickets revisited


 This is a continuation of the crickets problem that you
may have seen before (minus the data tidying).

Male tree crickets produce "mating songs" by rubbing their wings
together to produce a chirping sound. It is hypothesized that female
tree crickets identify males of the correct species by how fast (in
chirps per second) the male's mating song is. This is called the
"pulse rate".  Some data for two species of crickets are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/crickets2.csv) as a CSV
file. The columns are species (text), temperature, and pulse
rate (numbers). This is the tidied version of the data set that the
previous version of this question had you create.
The research question is whether males
of the different species have different average pulse rates. It is
also of interest to see whether temperature has an effect, and if
so, what.


(a) Read the data into R and display what you have.



(b) Do a two-sample $t$-test to see whether the mean pulse rates
differ between species. What do you conclude?



(c) Can you do that two-sample $t$-test as a regression?



(d) The analysis in the last part did not use temperature,
however. Is it possible that temperature also has an effect? To
assess this, draw a scatterplot of pulse rate against temperature,
with the points distinguished, somehow, by the species they are
from.^[This was the actual reason I thought of this      question originally:    I wanted you to do this.]



(e) What does the plot tell you that the $t$-test doesn't? How
would you describe differences in pulse rates between species now?



(f) Fit a regression predicting pulse rate from species and
temperature. Compare the P-value for species in this regression to
the one from the $t$-test. What does that tell you?



(g) Make suitable residual plots for the regression
`pulse.1`.
