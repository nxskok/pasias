##  Handling shipments


We learned earlier about a company called Global Electronics that
imports shipments of a certain large part used as a
component in several of its products. The size of the shipment varies
each time. Each shipment is sent to one of two warehouses (labelled A
and B) for handling. The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/global.csv) show the
`size` of each shipment (in thousands of parts) and the direct
`cost` of handling it, in thousands of dollars. Also shown is
the `warehouse` (A or B) that handled each shipment.



(a) Read the data into R and display your data frame.



(b) Make a scatterplot of the cost of handling each shipment as it
depends on the shipment's size.



(c) What kind of relationship do you see on the scatterplot? Do
you think a straight line would describe it appropriately? Explain briefly.



(d) When a shipment comes in, the cost of handling it is not
known. A decision is made about which warehouse to send it to, and
then, after it is handled, the cost is recorded. What do you think
determines which warehouse an incoming shipment goes to? Provide a
graph to support your answer.
