##  Getting an R Studio Cloud account


 Follow these steps to get an R Studio Cloud account.



(a) Point your web browser at [link](rstudio.cloud). (If you already
have R and R Studio installed on your computer, you can use that
instead, throughout the course; just do part (d) of this
question. Any references to R Studio Cloud in this assignment also
apply to R Studio on your computer.)


(b) Choose an account to use.


(c) Take a look around, and create a new Project. Give the new
project any name you like.


(d) Before we get to work, look for the blue `>` at the
bottom left. Click next to it to get a flashing cursor, and then
type what you see here (in blue):

Then press Enter.


(e) Not for now, but for later: if you are on a lab computer, you
should probably log out when you are done. To do that, find your
name at the top right. Click on it, and two things should pop out to
the right: Profile and Log Out. Select Log Out. You should be
returned to one of the screens you began with, possibly the Welcome
to R Studio Cloud one. 
To log back in, now or next time, look for
Log In at the top right. Click it, to get this:

and then you can log in with your email and password, or Google or
Github IDs, whichever you used.
Now we can get down to some actual work.
