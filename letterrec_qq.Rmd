##  Confusing letters


 Two researchers studied how often people mistook one letter
for another one. They did this by showing their subjects each
(uppercase) letter for a few milliseconds only, and asking them which
letter (out of a list) they just saw. The researchers obtain a
"confusion matrix" in which, for example, the W-Q entry is the total
of W's taken as Q and Q's taken as W. This confusion matrix is in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/letterrec.txt). Note that
the confusions are actually *similarities* rather than
dissimilarities: a large number means that the two letters concerned
are easily confused, that is, similar. Similarities can be converted
to dissimilarities by subtracting them from a larger number than
anything in the table (that is, subtracting from 21 is good here).



(a) Read in the confusion matrix and convert it to
dissimilarities and then to a
`dist` object, displaying the `dist` object that you
obtain. 



(b) Run a multidimensional scaling, with the default two
dimensions, on your `dist` object, and display the
results. (Making a graph is coming later.)


(c) Obtain a vector of the names of the letters that were
confused in this study. 


(d) Plot your multidimensional scaling map. To do this, first
create a data frame containing the points you want to plot and their
labels, and then plot the points labelled by the right thing.


(e) Pick a pair of letters appear close together on your
map. Does it make sense, from looking at these letters, that they
would be easy to confuse? Explain briefly.


(f) Verify that your chosen pair of letters was often confused
in the data.
