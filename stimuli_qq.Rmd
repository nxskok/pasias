##  Things that feel similar to each other


 Which objects feel similar to one another and which ones
feel different? Can we draw them on a "map"? 30
subjects^[Probably students in a psychology course. You know  how it goes.] were each
given 17 different objects to feel, for example "inner surface of pine  bark", 
"rubber eraser" and 
"nylon scouring pad". The
subjects had to group the objects into a maximum of 8 groups such that
the objects within a group felt similar, and the ones in different
groups felt different.^[The maximum number of groups was to  ensure that each subject actually *did* group some objects  together, rather than saying that they all feel different.] A
dissimilarity matrix was formed by counting how many subjects put each
pair of objects into *different* groups, so that the
dissimilarity ranged from 0 (the objects were always put together in
the same group) to 30 (the objects were not put together into the same
group by any of the subjects). 

The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/stimuli.txt). 



(a) Look at the data, and read in the file appropriately. Do you
have something square in shape, apart from any columns of object
names?  Do your columns have the same names as the objects?



(b) Obtain the names of the objects. Note that they are rather
long. 



(c) Set the column names of your data frame to be your object
names, using `names`. Before you rush to do that, figure out
how many column names you need, and supply values for any extra
ones. Check that your data frame now has the right column names.



(d) <a name="part:distances">*</a>  
Convert your data frame into a distance object. Take a look at the
(rather long) result.



(e) Obtain and plot a  (metric) multidimensional scaling map of
these data.  Label the points with the name of the
object they represent. (Note that
`geom_text_repel` has an option `size` that controls
the size of the text.)



(f) Find a pair of objects that are close together on your
plot. Look back at your answer to part~(<a href="#part:distances">here</a>): is
the distance between those objects small? Explain briefly.



(g) Obtain a measure of goodness of fit for this
multidimensional scaling map.



(h) Obtain a cluster analysis for the same data, using Ward's
method. Obtain a dendrogram. What seems to be an appropriate number
of clusters?  Mark them on your dendrogram too.



(i) Discuss as briefly as seems reasonable whether your
clusters tell the same story as the map that came from
multidimensional scaling. (There were only three marks for this, so you
don't need to go overboard.) Optionally, think about creating a plot
that will make it easier to see the correspondence between your
clusters and the MDS map.
