##  Calculating power and sample size for estimating mean


 We are planning a study to estimate a population mean. The
population standard deviation is believed to be 20, and the population
distribution is believed to be approximately normal. We will be
testing the null hypothesis that the population mean is 100. Suppose
the population mean is actually 110, and we want to determine how
likely we are to (correctly) reject the null hypothesis in this case,
using a two-sided (but one-sample) test with $\alpha=0.05$.



(a) We will take a sample of size $n=30$. Calculate the power of
this test.



(b) Find the sample size necessary to obtain a power
of at least 0.80 under these conditions. What sample size do you
need? Explain briefly how your answer is
consistent with (a).
