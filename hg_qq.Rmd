##  Hunter-gatherers in Australia


 A hunter-gatherer society is one where people get their food
by hunting, fishing or foraging rather than by agriculture or by
raising animals. Such societies tend to move from place to place.
Anthropologists have studied hunter-gatherer societies in forest
ecosystems across the world. The average population density of these
societies is 7.38 people per 100 km$^2$. Hunter-gatherer societies on
different continents might have different population densities,
possibly because of large-scale ecological constraints (such as
resource availability), or because of other factors, possibly social
and/or historic, determining population density.

Some hunter-gatherer societies in Australia were studied, and the
population density per 100 km$^2$ recorded for each. The data are in

(a) Read the data into R. Do you have the correct variables?
How many hunter-gatherer societies in Australia were studied?
Explain briefly.



(b) The question of interest is whether these Australian
hunter-gatherer societies are like the rest of the world in terms of mean
population density. State suitable null and alternative
hypotheses. *Define any symbols you use*: that is, if you use a
symbol, you also have to say what it means. 



(c) Test your hypotheses using a suitable test. What do you
conclude, in the context of the data?



(d) Do you have any doubts about the validity of your test?
Explain briefly, using a suitable graph to support your
explanation.
