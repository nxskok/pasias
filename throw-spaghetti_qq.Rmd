##  Baseball and softball spaghetti


 On a previous assignment, we found that students could throw
a baseball further than they could throw a softball. In this question,
we will make a graph called a "spaghetti plot" to illustrate this
graphically. (The issue previously was that the data were matched
pairs: the same students threw both balls.)

This seems to work most naturally by building a pipe, a line or two at
a time. See if you can do it that way. (If you can't make it work, use lots of
temporary data frames, one to hold the result of each part.)



(a) Read in the data again from
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/throw.txt). The
variables had no names, so supply some, as you did before.




(b) Create a new column that is the students turned into a `factor`,
adding it to your data frame. The reason for this will become clear
later.



(c) Collect together all the throwing distances into one column,
making a second column that says which ball was thrown.



(d) Using your new data frame, make a "scatterplot" of throwing
distance against type of ball.



(e) Add two things to your plot: something that will distinguish
the students by colour (this works best if the thing distinguished
by colour is a factor),^[You can try it without. See below.]
and something that will join the two points for the same student by
a line.



(f) The legend is not very informative. Remove it from the plot,
using `guides`.



(g) What do you see on the final spaghetti plot? What does that tell you
about the relative distances a student can throw a baseball vs. a
softball? Explain briefly, blah blah blah.
