 When a person has a heart attack and survives it, the major
concern of health professionals is to prevent the person having a
second heart attack. Two factors that are believed to be important are
anger and anxiety; if a heart attack survivor tends to be angry or
anxious, they are believed to put themselves at increased risk of a
second heart attack.

Twenty heart attack survivors took part in a study. Each one was given
a test designed to assess their anxiety (a higher score on the test
indicates higher anxiety), and some of the survivors took an anger
management course. 
The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ha2.txt); `y` and
`n` denote "yes" and "no" respectively. The columns denote
(i) whether or not the person had a second heart attack, (ii) whether
or not the person took the anger management class, (iii) the anxiety
score. 



(a) Read in and display the data.


(b) <a name="part:fit">*</a> 
Fit a logistic regression predicting whether or not a heart attack
survivor has a second heart attack, as it depends on anxiety score
and whether or not the person took the anger management
class. Display the results.


(c) In the previous part, how can you tell that you were
predicting the probability of having a second heart attack (as
opposed to the probability of not having one)?


(d) <a name="part:preds">*</a>
For the two possible values `y` and `n` of
`anger` and the anxiety scores 40, 50 and 60, make a data
frame containing all six combinations, and use it to obtain
predicted probabilities of a second heart attack. Display your
predicted probabilities side by side with what they are predictions
for.


(e) Use your predictions from the previous part to describe the
effect of changes in `anxiety` and `anger` on the
probability of a second heart attack.


(f) Are the effects you described in the previous part
consistent with the `summary` output from `glm` that
you obtained in (<a href="#part:fit">here</a>)? Explain briefly how they are, or
are not. (You need an explanation for each of `anxiety` and
`anger`, and you will probably get confused if you look at
the P-values, so don't.)
