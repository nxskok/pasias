##  Ovarian cancer


 R's `survival` package contains several data
sets. One of these is called `ovarian`; it comes from a study
of 26 ovarian cancer patients. The major purpose of this study was to
compare the effects of two treatments on survival time.



(a) Obtain and display (all of) the data set. This is as simple as
loading the package and typing the data set's name.


(b) The columns of interest to us are:


* `futime`: the time for which a patient was followed-up:
the number of days until either they died or the study ended (or
they withdrew from the study for some other reason).

* `fustat`: follow-up status: 1 if the patient died of
ovarian cancer, 0 if they were still alive when the study ended.

* `age`: of patient, at diagnosis, in years

* `rx`: treatment, numbered 1 or 2, but really labels for
the two treatments.

Create and display a suitable response variable `y` for a Cox
proportional-hazards model.


(c) In the display of your response variable, some values are
marked with a `+`. Why is that? Explain briefly. (If you use
a technical term, you should explain what it means.)


(d) Fit a Cox proportional-hazards model for predicting
survival time from age and treatment. Note that the numeric values
for treatment make sense only as labels for the two treatments, so
in your model formula make treatment into a factor. Display the
results. 


(e) Is there a significant difference between the treatments in
terms of their effects on survival (from ovarian cancer)?


(f) Is there a significant effect of age? If there is, describe
the effect that age has on survival.


(g) Make a martingale residual plot for this model. Do you see
any problems? Explain briefly.


(h) Find the quartiles of `age`, and make a data frame
containing all combinations of those two ages and the two
treatments. Display what you have. (Feel free to copy the values by
hand, rather than trying to save them and use them.)



(i) Obtain predicted survival probabilities for each of your
age-treatment combinations, for each of a variety of survival
times. (This is only one thing, despite it sounding like a lot.)



(j) Draw a plot that compares the survival probabilities at the
different times.



(k) According to your plot, how would you describe the effects of
treatment and of age?
