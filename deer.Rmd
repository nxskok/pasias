##  Deer and how much they eat


 Do adult deer eat different amounts of food at different
times of the year? The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/deer.txt) are the weights
of food (in kilograms) consumed by randomly selected adult deer
observed at different times of the year (in February, May, August and
November). We will assume that these were different deer observed in
the different months. (If the same animals had been observed at
different times, we would have been in the domain of 
"repeated measures", which would require a different analysis, 
beyond the scope
of this course.)



(a) Read the data into R, and calculate numbers of observations
and the median amounts of food
eaten each month.
 
Solution


The usual stuff for data values separated by (single) spaces:
```{r deer-1 }
myurl <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/deer.txt"
deer <- read_delim(myurl, " ")
```

     

and then, recalling that `n()` is the handy way of getting the
number of observations in each group:

```{r deer-2 }
deer %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), med = median(food))
```

 

When you want the number of observations *plus* some other
summaries, as here, the group-by and summarize idea is the way, using
`n()` to get the number of observations in each
group. `count` counts the number of observations per group when
you *only* have grouping variables.

The medians differ a bit, but it's hard to judge without a sense of
spread, which the boxplots (next) provide. November is a bit higher
and May a bit lower.
 
$\blacksquare$

(b) Make side-by-side boxplots of the amount of food eaten each
month. Comment briefly on what you see. 
 
Solution


```{r endinger}
ggplot(deer, aes(x = month, y = food)) + geom_boxplot()
```

     

This offers the suggestion that maybe November will be significantly
higher than the rest and May significantly lower, or at least they
will be significantly different from each other.

This is perhaps getting ahead of the game: we should be thinking about
spread and shape. Bear in mind that there are only 5 or 6 observations
in each group, so you won't be able to say much about normality. In
any case, we are going to be doing a Mood's median test, so any lack
of normality doesn't matter (eg. perhaps that 4.4 observation in
August). Given the small sample sizes, I actually think the spreads
are quite similar.

Another way of looking at the data, especially with these small sample
sizes, is a "dot plot": instead of making a boxplot for each month,
we plot the actual points for each month as if we were making a
scatterplot:

```{r vongiengen}
ggplot(deer, aes(x = month, y = food)) + geom_point()
```

 

Wait a minute. There were five deer in February and six in
August. Where did they go?

The problem is *overplotting*: more than one of the deer plotted
in the same place on the plot, because the amounts of food eaten were
only given to one decimal place and there were some duplicated values.
One way to solve this is to randomly
move the points around so that no two of them plot in the same
place. This is called *jittering*, and is done like this:

```{r kaisers}
ggplot(deer, aes(x = month, y = food)) + geom_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.05)
```

 

Now you see all the deer, and you can see that two pairs of points in
August and one pair of points in February are close enough on the
jittered plot that they would have been the same to one decimal place.

I wanted to
keep the points above the months they belong to, so I only allowed vertical
jitter (that's the `width` and `height` in the
`geom_jitter`; the width is zero so there is no horizontal
jittering). 
If you like, you can colour the
months; it's up to you whether you think that's making the plot easier
to read, or is overkill (see my point on the facetted plots on the
2017 midterm).

This way you see the whole distribution for each month. Normally it's
nicer to see the summary made by the boxplots, but here there are not
very many points. The value of 4.4 in August does look quite a bit
lower than the rest, but the other months look believably normal given
the small sample sizes. I don't know about equal spreads (November
looks more spread out), but normality looks believable. Maybe this is
the kind of situation in which Welch's ANOVA is a good idea. (If you
believe that the normality-with-unequal-spreads is a reasonable
assumption to make, then the Welch ANOVA will be more powerful than
the Mood's median test, and so should be preferred.)
 
$\blacksquare$

(c) Run a Mood's median test as in lecture (ie.\ not using
`smmr`). What do you conclude, in the context of the data? 
 
Solution


To give you some practice with the mechanics, first find the
overall median:
```{r deer-3 }
deer %>% summarize(med = median(food))
```

     

or

```{r deer-4 }
median(deer$food)
```

 

I like the first way because it's the same idea as we did before, just
not differentiating by month. I think there are some observations
exactly equal to the median, which will mess things up later:

```{r deer-5 }
deer %>% filter(food == 4.7)
```

 

There are, two in February and two in August.

Next, make (and save) a table of the observations within each month
that are above and below this median:

```{r deer-6 }
tab1 <- with(deer, table(month, food < 4.7))
tab1
```

 

or

```{r deer-7 }
tab2 <- with(deer, table(month, food > 4.7))
tab2
```

 

Either of these is good, but note that they are different. Two of the
February observations (the ones that were exactly 4.7) have 
"switched sides", 
and (look carefully) two of the August ones also.  Hence the
test results will be different, and `smmr` (later) will give
different results again:

```{r deer-8 }
chisq.test(tab1, correct = F)
chisq.test(tab2, correct = F)
```

 

The warnings are because of the small frequencies. If you've done
these by hand before (which you will have if you took PSYC08), you'll
remember that thing about "expected frequencies less than 5". This
is that. It means "don't take those P-values *too* seriously."

The P-values are different, but they are both clearly significant, so the
median amounts of food eaten in the different months are not all the
same. (This is the same "there are differences" that you get from an
ANOVA, which you would follow up with Tukey.) Despite the injunction
not to take the P-values too seriously, I think these are small enough
that they could be off by a bit without affecting the conclusion.

The first table came out with a smaller P-value because it looked more
extreme: all of the February measurements were taken as higher than
the overall median (since we were counting "strictly less" and 
"the rest"). In the second table, the February measurements look more
evenly split, so the overall P-value is not quite so small.

You can make a guess as to what `smmr` will come out with
(next), since it throws away any data values exactly equal to the median.
 
$\blacksquare$

(d) Run a Mood's median test using `smmr`, and compare the
results with the previous part.
 
Solution


Off we go:
```{r deer-9 }
library(smmr)
median_test(deer, food, month)
```

     

The P-value came out in between the other two, but the conclusion is
the same all three ways: the months are not all the same in terms of
median food eaten. The researchers can then go ahead and try to figure
out *why* the animals eat different amounts in the different months.

You might be wondering how you could get rid of the equal-to-median
values in the build-it-yourself way. This is `filter` from
`dplyr`, which you use first:

```{r deer-10 }
deer2 <- deer %>% filter(food != 4.7)
tab3 <- with(deer2, table(month, food < 4.7))
tab3
chisq.test(tab3)
```

 

which is exactly what `smmr` does, so the answer is
identical.^[The computer scientists among you will note that I  should not use equals or not-equals to compare a decimal  floating-point number, since decimal numbers are not represented exactly in the computer. R, however, is ahead of us here, since when you try to do "food not equal to 4.7", it tests whether food is more than a small distance away from 4.7, which is the right way to do it. In R, therefore, code like my `food !=  4.7` does exactly what I want, but in a language like C, it *does not*, and you have to be more careful: `abs(food-4.7)>1e-8`, or something like that. The small number `1e-8` ($10^{-8}$) is typically equal to **machine epsilon**, the smallest number on a computer that is distinguishable from zero.]
How would an ANOVA come out here? My guess is, very similarly:

```{r deer-11 }
deer.1 <- aov(food ~ month, data = deer)
summary(deer.1)
TukeyHSD(deer.1)
```

 

The conclusion is the same, but the P-value on the $F$-test is much
smaller. I think this is because the $F$-test uses the actual values,
rather than just whether they are bigger or smaller than 4.7. The
Tukey says that all the months are different in terms of (now) mean,
except for February and August, which were those two very similar ones
on the boxplot.

(e) How is it that Mood's median test does not completely answer the
question you really want to answer? How might you get an answer to the
question you *really* want answered? Explain briefly, and obtain
the answer you *really* want, discussing your results briefly.



Solution


That's rather a lot, so let's take those things one at a
time.^[Most of these parts are old from assignment questions that I actually asked a previous class to do, but not this part. I added it later.]

Mood's median test is really like the $F$-test in ANOVA: it's testing
the null hypothesis
that the groups (months) all have the same median (of food eaten),
against the alternative that the null is not true. We rejected this
null, but we don't know which months differ significantly from
which. To resolve this in ANOVA, we do Tukey (or Games-Howell if we
did the Welch ANOVA). The corresponding thing here is to do all the
possible two-group Mood tests on all the pairs of groups, and, after
adjusting for doing (here) six tests at once, look at the adjusted
P-values to see how the months differ in terms of food eaten.

This is accomplished in `smmr` via `pairwise_median_test`,
thus: 

```{r deer-12 }
pairwise_median_test(deer, food, month)
```

 

This compares each month with each other month. Looking at the last
column, there are only three significant differences: August-November,
February-May and May-November. Going back to the table of medians we
made in (a), November is significantly higher (in terms of median food
eaten) than August and May (but not February), and February is
significantly higher than May. The other differences are not big
enough to be significant.

Extra: Pairwise median tests done this way are not likely to be very
sensitive (that is, powerful), for a couple of reasons: (i) the usual
one that the median tests don't use the data very efficiently, and
(ii) the way I go from the unadjusted to the adjusted P-values is via
Bonferroni (here, multiply the P-values by 6), which is known to be
safe but conservative. This is why the Tukey produced more significant
differences among the months than the pairwise median tests did.

$\blacksquare$
