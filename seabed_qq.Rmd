##  Sites on the sea bed


 Biologists investigate the prevalence of
species of organism by sampling sites where the organisms might be,
taking a "grab" from the site, and sending the grabs to a laboratory
for analysis. The data in this question come from the sea bed. There
were 30 sites, labelled `s1` through `s30`. At each
site, five species of organism, labelled `a` through
`e`, were of interest; the data shown in those columns of the
data set were the number of organisms of that species identified in
the grab from that site. There are some other columns in the
(original) data set that will not concern us. Our interest is in
seeing which sites are similar to which other sites, so that a cluster
analysis will be suitable.

When the data are counts of different species, as they are here,
biologists often measure the dissimilarity in species prevalence
profiles between two sites using something called the Bray-Curtis
dissimilarity. It is not important to understand this for this
question (though I explain it in my solutions). I calculated the
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between each pair of sites and stored the
results in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/seabed1.csv). 



(a) Read in the dissimilarity data and check that you have 30
rows and 30 columns of dissimilarities.



(b) Create a distance object out of your dissimilarities,
bearing in mind that the values are distances (well,
dissimilarities) already.



(c) Fit a cluster analysis using single-linkage, and display a
dendrogram of the results.



(d) Now fit a cluster analysis using Ward's method, and display
a dendrogram of the results.



(e) <a name="part:prefclust">*</a> On the Ward's method clustering, how many clusters would you
choose to divide the sites into? Draw rectangles around those clusters.




(f) <a name="part:original">*</a> The original data is in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/seabed.csv). Read in the
original data and verify that you again have 30 sites, variables
called `a` through `e` and some others.




(g) Go back to your Ward method dendrogram with the red
rectangles and find two sites in the same cluster. Display the
original data for your two sites and see if you can explain why they
are in the same cluster. It doesn't matter which two sites you choose;
the grader will merely check that your results look reasonable.




(h) Obtain the cluster memberships for each site, for your
preferred number of clusters from part (<a href="#part:prefclust">here</a>). Add a
column to the original data that you read in, in part
(<a href="#part:original">here</a>), containing those cluster memberships, *as a
factor*.  Obtain a plot that will enable you to assess the
relationship between those clusters and `pollution`. (Once you
have the cluster memberships, you can add them to the data frame and
make the graph using a pipe.)  What do you see?
