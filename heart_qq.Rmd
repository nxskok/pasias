##  How not to get heart disease


 What is associated with heart disease? In a study, a large
number of variables were measured, as follows:



* `age` (years)

* `sex` male or female

* `pain.type` Chest pain type (4 values: typical angina,
atypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic)

* `resting.bp` Resting blood pressure, on admission to hospital

* `serum.chol` Serum cholesterol

* `high.blood.sugar`: greater than 120, yes or no

* `electro` resting electrocardiographic results (normal,
having ST-T, hypertrophy)

* `max.hr` Maximum heart rate

* `angina` Exercise induced angina (yes or no)

* `oldpeak` ST depression induced by exercise relative to
rest. See [link](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ecg-library/st-segment/).

* `slope` Slope of peak exercise ST segment. Sloping up,
flat or sloping down

* `colored` number of major vessels (0--3) coloured by fluoroscopy

* `thal` normal, fixed defect, reversible defect

* `heart.disease` 1=absent, 2=present


I don't know what most of those are, but we will not let that stand in
our way. Our aim is to find out what variables are associated with
heart disease, and what values of those variables give high
probabilities of heart disease being present. The data are in
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/heartf.csv).



(a) Read in the data. Display the first few lines and convince
yourself that those values are reasonable.



(b) In a logistic regression, what probability will be
predicted here? Explain briefly but convincingly. (Is each line of
the data file one observation or a summary of several?)



(c) <a name="part:heart-first">*</a> Fit a logistic regression predicting heart disease from
everything else (if you have a column called `X` or
`X1`, ignore that), and display the results.



(d) Quite a lot of our explanatory variables are factors. To
assess whether the factor as a whole should stay or can be removed,
looking at the slopes won't help us very much (since they tell us
whether the other levels of the factor differ from the baseline,
which may not be a sensible comparison to make). To assess which
variables are candidates to be removed, factors included (properly),
we can use `drop1`. Feed `drop1` a fitted model and
the words `test="Chisq"` (take care of the capitalization!)
and you'll get a list of P-values. Which variable is the one that
you would remove first? Explain briefly.



(e) I'm not going to make you do the whole backward elimination
(I'm going to have you use `step` for that later), but do one
step: that is, fit a model removing the variable you think should be
removed, using `update`, and then run `drop1` again to
see which variable will be removed next.



(f) Use `step` to do a backward elimination to find which
variables have an effect on heart disease. Display your final model
(which you can do by saving the output from `step` in a
variable, and asking for the summary of that. In `step`,
you'll need to specify a starting model (the one from part
(<a href="#part:heart-first">here</a>)), the direction of elimination, and the test
to base the elimination decision on (the same one as you used in
`drop1`). 



(g) Display the summary of the model that came out of `step`.



(h) We are going to make a large number of predictions. Create
a data frame that contains all combinations of representative
values for all the variables in the model that came out of
`step`. By "representative" I mean all the values for a
categorical variable, and the first and third quartiles for a numeric
variable.



(i) Obtain the predicted probabilities of heart disease for
the data frame you constructed in the last part, using your
model that came out of `step`. Add these predictions to
the data frame from the previous part (as a column in that data
frame). 



(j) Find the largest predicted probability (which is the
predicted probability of heart disease) and display all the
variables that it was a prediction for. 



(k) Compare the `summary` of the final model from
`step` with your highest predicted heart disease
probability and the values of the other variables that make it
up. Are they consistent?
