##  Roller coasters


 A poll on the Discovery Channel asked people to nominate the
best roller-coasters in the United States. We will examine the 10
roller-coasters that received the most votes. Two features of a
roller-coaster that are of interest are the distance it drops from
start to finish, measured here in feet^[Roller-coasters work by   gravity, so there must be some drop.] and the duration of the ride,
measured in seconds. Is it true that roller-coasters with a bigger
drop also tend to have a longer ride? The data are at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/coasters.csv).^[These are not to be confused with what your mom insists that you place between your coffee mug and the table.]



(a) Read the data into R and verify that you have a sensible
number of rows and columns.



(b) Make a scatterplot of duration (response) against drop
(explanatory), labelling each roller-coaster with its name in such a
way that the labels do not overlap. Add a regression line to your plot.



(c) Would you say that roller-coasters with a larger drop tend
to have a longer ride? Explain briefly.



(d) Find a roller-coaster that is unusual compared to the
others. What about its combination of `drop` and
`duration` is unusual?
