Here is the built-in data set `mtcars`, with some information about 32 different cars:

```{r}
mtcars
```

We look at a numerical summary of each of the eleven (quantitative) variables:

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

For the `mpg` column, the mean is larger than the median, so we suspect that the distribution will be right-skewed. This can be confirmed by looking at a boxplot:

```{r}
boxplot(mtcars$mpg)
```

The longer upper whisker indicates a right skew.
