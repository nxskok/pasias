Data from Watkins, Scheaffer and Cobb, ex E55 page 74.

## Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Constructing the data

I have speeds and counts:

```{r}
counts=tribble(
  ~speed_int, ~count,
  25, 2, 
  26, 31,
  27, 92,
  28, 149,
  29, 178,
  30, 156,
  31, 157,
  32, 99,
  33, 74,
  34, 31,
  35, 16,
  36, 13,
  37, 1, 
  38, 1
)
counts
```

Turn this back into an actual data frame

```{r}
counts %>% 
  mutate(speed=map2(speed_int,count,~rep(.x,.y))) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  select(speed) %>% 
  sample_frac(1) %>% 
  mutate(car_no=row_number()) %>% 
  select(2:1) ->
speeds
speeds
```

check by reconstituting the table

```{r}
speeds %>% count(speed)
```

save

```{r}
write_csv(speeds,"car-speeds.csv")
```
