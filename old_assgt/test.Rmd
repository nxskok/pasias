Here is a data set. I have no idea where it comes from:

```{r}
x=c(10,11,13,17,22,29)
x
```

We summarize the data:

```{r}
summary(x)
```

The mean is a little higher than the median, and the highest value is a fair bit higher than the third quartile, suggesting a distribution that is skewed to the right. To investigate further, we can look at a boxplot:

```{r}
boxplot(x)
```

The long upper whisker further supports the idea of right-skewedness.
