##  Getting started


 This question is to get you started using R.


(a) Start R Studio Cloud, in some project. (If you started up a
new project in the previous question and are still logged in, use
that; if not, create a new project.)


(b) We're going to do some stuff in R here, just to get used to
it. First, make an R Notebook by selecting File, New File and R
Notebook.


(c) Change the title to something of your choosing. Then go down
to line 5, click on the Insert button and select R. You should see
a "code chunk" appear at line 5, which we are going to use in a
moment. 


(d) Type the line of code shown below into the chunk in the
R Notebook:

```

mtcars

```



(e) Run this command. To do that, look at the top right of
your code chunk block (shaded in a slightly different colour). You
should see a gear symbol, a down arrow and a green "play    button". 
Click the play button. This will run the code, and show
the output below the code chunk.


(f) Something a little more interesting: `summary`
obtains a summary of whatever you feed it (the five-number summary
plus the mean for numerical variables). Obtain this for our data
frame. To do this, create a new code chunk below the previous one,
type `summary(mtcars)` into the code chunk, and run it.


(g) Let's make a boxplot of the gas mileage data. This is a 
"poor man's boxplot"; we'll see a nicer-looking way later. To do it
this way, make another new code chunk, enter the code
`boxplot(mtcars$mpg)` into it, and run the chunk.


(h) Some aesthetics to finish with: delete the template notebook
(all the stuff you didn't type below your code chunks and
output). Then add some narrative text above and below your code
chunks. Above the code chunk is where you say what you are going
to do (and maybe why you are doing it), and below is where you say
what you conclude from the output you just obtained.


(i) Save your notebook (the usual way with File and Save). This
saves it *on the R Studio Cloud servers* (and not on your
computer). This means that when you come back to R Studio Cloud
later, even from another device, this notebook will still be
available to you.
Now click Preview. This produces a pretty HTML version of your
notebook.


(j) Optional extra: practice handing in your previewed R
notebook, as if it were an assignment that was worth
something. (It is good to get the practice in a low-stakes
situation, so that you'll know what to do next week.)


(k) Optional extra. Something more ambitious: make a scatterplot of gas
mileage `mpg`, on the $y$ axis, against horsepower,
`hp`, on the $x$-axis.
