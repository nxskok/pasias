##  Executive salaries


 A management consultancy obtained data on salaries and other
work information of 100 company executives (from different
companies). Their aim was to predict salary from some or all of the
other variables (and to determine which of those other variables are
important determinants of salary). The data are in
[http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/execsal.xlsx](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/execsal.xlsx), as an
Excel spreadsheet, with the
columns being (respectively):



* Row number (ignore)

* Log of annual salary

* experience (years)

* education (years)


* gender (1=male, 0=female)

* number of employees supervised

* corporate assets (millions of dollars)


* board member (1=yes, 0=no)

* age (years)

* company profits (past 12 months, millions of dollars)

* has international responsibility (1=yes, 0=no)


* company's total sales (past 12 months, millions of dollars)


The consultancy used log of salary because the relationship with other
variables (in previous studies) seemed to be straighter. (A
consequence of using logs is that a one-unit increase in any of the
other variables is associated with a certain *percentage*
increase in annual salary, which often makes sense.) Note that the
data set already contains a variable `logsal`, which is the
log-salary, so you don't need to create one.



(a) Read the data into SAS, bearing in mind the format of the
data. You'll need to know the name of the sheet you want to read
in. Also, reading an Excel file only works "locally": that is,
you'll need to grab your own copy of the spreadsheet and upload it
to SAS Studio.


Solution


First, open the spreadsheet and take a look at it. The sheet you
want is called `execsal2`. Save it somewhere on your
computer and then upload it to SAS Studio.
Then, find a previous `proc import` with
`dbms=xlsx`, and adapt it to what you need, replacing my
username with yours:

\begin{Datastep}
proc import
datafile='/home/ken/execsal.xlsx'
dbms=xlsx
out=salaries
replace;
sheet=execsal2;
getnames=yes;
\end{Datastep}

Or remember DODRG and this time note that you need an extra S for "sheet".

I ran that through `proc print` to check that I had the right
thing, and I did. Or you can summarize:

\begin{Sascode}[store=wucuz]
proc means;  
\end{Sascode}

\Listing[store=wucuz, fontsize=footnotesize]{wucuzz}

As you see, there are 100 rows of data, which would be a lot for
someone else to look at. The names (you can check) match up with what
I said the variables were.



(b) Run a regression predicting log-salary from everything else,
except row number. Show the text output (here and below).


Solution


\begin{Sascode}[store=exa]
proc reg;
model logsal=exp educ gender sup cass board age profits int sales;
\end{Sascode}

with output
\Listing[store=exa,fontsize=small]{exaa}

and the graphs

\Graphic[store=exa, scale=0.8]{exab}

I didn't ask you to look at the plots, because I wanted you to do the
variable-elimination (coming up). Normally, you would check that
things are at least approximately OK, here and at the end. So I'll do
it here, starting with the array of nine graphs of which I look at the
usual two:



* residuals vs.\ fitted values, top left: a tiny bit of evidence
of fanning-in, since the four residuals farthest from zero are all
on the left. I'd really want more evidence of fanning-in than this,
though.

* normal quantile plot of residuals: as straight as you could wish
for. 

* There are a lot of explanatory variables, and we get a plot of
residuals against each one. These look pretty random and trend-free,
so I don't think we need to be concerned. Note that some of the
variables take only a few possible values (they are rather
discrete), so you get stacks of points one above another, eg. for
profits. Some of the explanatory variables are either 0 or 1 (these
are "indicators" for categorical variables with two
categories). For these, you want both categories to have average
residual around zero with equal spread. For `gender` 1, the
males, the residuals appear less spread out. I think we will have to
live with that. (Another way would be to do the regression twice,
for males and females separately.)




(c) Which explanatory variable is least significant? Run a
regression without it.


Solution


This question is going to involve a great deal of copying and
pasting. `sales` comes out first:

\begin{Sascode}[store=exb]
proc reg;
model logsal=exp educ gender sup cass board age profits int;
\end{Sascode}

with output

\Listing[store=exb]{exbb}



(d) Continue removing the least significant variable until you
need to stop, and explain briefly why you stopped.


Solution


You might guess that `board`, `age`,  `profits` and
`int` will need to come out, but take them one at a
time, `age` first:
\begin{Sascode}[store=exc]
proc reg;
model logsal=exp educ gender sup cass board profits int;
\end{Sascode}

giving

\Listing[store=exc]{excc}

Then `profits`:

\begin{Sascode}[store=exd]
proc reg;
model logsal=exp educ gender sup cass board int;
\end{Sascode}

giving

\Listing[store=exd]{exdd}

Then `board`:

\begin{Sascode}[store=exe]
proc reg;
model logsal=exp educ gender sup cass int;
\end{Sascode}

\Listing[store=exe]{exee}

Finally (we hope) `int`:

\begin{Sascode}[store=exf]
proc reg;
model logsal=exp educ gender sup cass;
\end{Sascode}

\Listing[store=exf]{exff}
Yep, that's the end. Everything else is strongly significant and has
to stay in the model.

Also note that R-squared began and also ended around 92\%: taking out
those variables has had only a tiny effect on the fit of the model.



(e) Which explanatory variables are in your final model? Name them
in full. That is, don't just list the names of the variables.


Solution


These ones:


* Years of experience

* Years of education

* Gender

* Number of employees supervised

* Corporate assets




(f) Look at each of your slope coefficients. Are they positive or
negative? Does that make sense in the context of this problem?


Solution


Mine are all positive. That is, someone who has more years of
experience, more education, supervises more employees or works
in a company with more corporate assets would be expected to
receive a higher salary. We'd expect all of these variables to
have this kind of effect.
The one I didn't talk about was `gender`. This is also
positive. Since males were 1 and females 0, according to the
question, this means that males are expected to make more than
females, *all else being equal*. This may not make you
happy, but it's what the data are saying. (And note the strength
of the conclusion: it's \emph{after adjusting for any other
differences between males and females}.)
The right thing to do next is to look at residual plots for your
final model. The *right* thing to do is to split your data
into a "training set" with which you build your model, and a
separate "test set" on which you see how well it works. But
that's farther than we go now.
SAS also contains a procedure called `glmselect`, which
automates this process. Here's how it looks for this dataset:
\begin{Sascode}[store=exh]
proc glmselect;
model logsal=exp educ gender sup cass board age profits int sales
/ selection=backward;
\end{Sascode}

with output

\Listing[store=exh]{exhh}

You can read through the output to see which variables were removed at
each step, and which ones were left at the end: the same five as we
found, since the procedure is supposed to be identical. 

`proc glmselect` can also produce plots. See the baseball
example at
[https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_glmselect_sect030.htm](https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_glmselect_sect030.htm)
for illustrations. 

We should probably look at our residual plots (from our last
regression) just to make sure that all is OK:

\Graphic[store=exf, scale=0.7]{exfg}

The few issues we have are the same as before, which we decided to
live with.
