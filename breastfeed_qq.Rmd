##  Successful breastfeeding


 A regular pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, and a
baby that is born at or before 33 weeks is called
"premature". The number of weeks at which a baby is born is called
its "gestational age". 
Premature babies are usually smaller than normal and
may require special care. It is a good sign if, when the mother and
baby leave the hospital to go home, the baby is successfully breastfeeding.

The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/breastfeed.csv) are from
a study of 64 premature infants. There are three columns: the
gestational age (a whole number of weeks), the number of babies of
that gestational age that were successfully breastfeeding when they
left the hospital, and the number that were not. (There were multiple
babies of the same gestational age, so the 64 babies are summarized in
6 rows of data.)



(a) Read the data into R and display the data frame.




(b) Verify that there were indeed 64 infants, by having R do a
suitable calculation on your data frame that gives the right answer
for the right reason.



(c) Do you think, looking at the data, that there is a
relationship between gestational age and whether or not the baby was
successfully breastfeeding when it left the hospital? Explain briefly.



(d) Why is logistic regression a sensible technique to use
here? Explain briefly.



(e) Fit a logistic regression to predict the probability that
an infant will be breastfeeding from its gestational age. Show the
output from your logistic regression.



(f) Does the significance or non-significance of the slope of
`gest.age` surprise you? Explain briefly.



(g) Is your slope (in the `Estimate` column) positive or
negative? What does that mean, in terms of gestational ages and
breastfeeding? Explain briefly.
 


(h) Obtain the predicted probabilities that an infant will
successfully breastfeed for a representative collection of gestational ages.
