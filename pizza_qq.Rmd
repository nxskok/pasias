##  Calories and fat in pizza


 
The file at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/Pizza.csv) 
came from a spreadsheet of information about 24 brands
of pizza: specifically, per 5-ounce serving, the number of calories,
the grams of fat, and the cost (in US dollars). The names of the pizza
brands are quite long. This file may open in a spreadsheet when you
browse to the link, depending on your computer's setup.



(a) Read in the data and display at least some of the data
frame. Are the variables of the right types? (In particular, why is
the number of calories labelled one way and the cost labelled a
different way?)


(b) Make a scatterplot for predicting calories from the number
of grams of fat. Add a smooth trend. What kind of relationship do
you see, if any?


(c) Fit a straight-line relationship, and display the intercept,
slope, R-squared, etc. Is there a real relationship between the two
variables, or is any apparent trend just chance?


(d) Obtain a plot of the residuals against the fitted values
for this regression. Does this indicate that there are any problems
with this regression, or not? Explain briefly.


(e) The research assistant in this study returns with two
new brands of pizza (ones that were not in the original data). The
fat content of a 5-ounce serving was 12 grams for the first brand
and 20 grams for the second brand. For each of these brands of
pizza, obtain a suitable 95\% interval for the number of calories
contained in a 5-ounce serving.
