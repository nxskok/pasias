##   The Interpersonal Circumplex


 The "IPIP Interpersonal Circumplex" (see
[link](http://ipip.ori.org/newIPIP-IPCSurvey.htm)) is a personal
behaviour survey, where respondents have to rate how accurately a
number of statements about behaviour apply to them, on a scale from
1 ("very inaccurate") to 5 ("very accurate"). A survey was done
on 459 people, using a 44-item variant of the above questionnaire,
where the statements were as follows. Put an "I" or an "I am" in
front of each one:


* talkative

* find fault

* do a thorough job

* depressed

* original

* reserved

* helpful

* careless

* relaxed

* curious

* full of energy

* start quarrels

* reliable

* tense

* ingenious

* generate enthusiasm in others

* forgiving

* disorganized

* worry

* imaginative

* quiet

* trusting

* lazy

* emotionally stable

* inventive

* assertive

* cold and aloof

* persevere

* moody

* value artistic experiences

* shy

* considerate

* efficient

* calm in tense situations

* prefer routine work

* outgoing

* sometimes rude

* stick to plans

* nervous

* reflective

* have few artistic interests

* co-operative

* distractible

* sophisticated in art and music

I don't know what a "circumplex" is, but I know it's not one of those "hat" accents that they have in French.
The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/personality.txt). The
columns `PERS01` through `PERS44` represent the above traits.


(a) Read in the data and check that you have the right number
of rows and columns.


(b) There are some missing values among these
responses. Eliminate all the individuals with any missing values
(since `princomp` can't handle them).


(c) Carry out a principal components analysis and obtain a
scree plot. 


(d) How many components/factors should you use? Explain briefly.


(e) <a name="part:score">*</a> Using your preferred number of factors, run a factor
analysis. Obtain "r"-type factor scores, as in class. You don't need to look at any output yet.


(f) Obtain the factor loadings. How much of the variability
does your chosen number of factors explain?


(g) Interpret each of your chosen number of factors. That is,
for each factor, identify the items that load heavily on it (you
can be fairly crude about this, eg. use a cutoff like 0.4 in
absolute value), and translate these items into the statements
given in each item. Then, if you can, name what the items loading
heavily on each factor have in common. Interpret a negative
loading as "not" whatever the item says.


(h) Find a person who is extreme on each of your first three
factors (one at a time). For each of these people, what kind of
data should they have for the relevant ones of variables
`PERS01` through `PERS44`? Do they? Explain
reasonably briefly.


(i) Check the uniquenesses. Which one(s) seem unusually
high? Check these against the factor loadings. Are these what you
would expect?
