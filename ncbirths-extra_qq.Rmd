##  More about the NC births


 This is an exploration of
some extra issues around the North Carolina births data set.




(a) How short does a pregnancy have to be, for the birth to be
classified as "premature"? Deduce this from the data, by drawing a
suitable graph or otherwise. 




(b) Explore the relationship between birth weight and
length of pregancy ("gestation") using a suitable graph. What do you
see?




(c) Do a web search to find the standard (North American)
definition of a premature birth. Does that correspond to what you saw
in the data? Cite the website you used, for example by saying
"according to `URL`, ldots", with `URL` replaced by
the address of the website you found.
