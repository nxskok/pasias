##  Salaries of social workers


 Another salary-prediction question: does the number of years
of work experience that a social worker has help to predict their 
salary? Data for 50 social workers are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/socwork.txt). 



(a) Read the data into R. Check that you have 50 observations on
two variables. Also do something to check that the years of
experience and annual salary figures look reasonable overall.



(b) Make a scatterplot showing how salary depends on
experience. Does the nature of the trend make sense?



(c) Fit a regression predicting salary from experience, and
display the results. Is the slope positive or negative? Does that
make sense?



(d) Obtain and plot the residuals against the fitted values. What
problem do you see?



(e) The problem you unearthed in the previous part is often helped
by a transformation. Run Box-Cox on your data to find a suitable
transformation. What transformation is suggested?



(f) Calculate a new variable as suggested by your
transformation. Use your transformed response in a regression,
showing the summary.



(g) Obtain and plot the residuals against the fitted values for
this regression. Do you seem to have solved the problem with the
previous residual plot?
