##  Making soap


Previously, we learned about a company that operates two production lines in a factory for
making soap bars. The production lines were
labelled A and B. A production line that moves faster may produce more
soap, but may possibly also produce more "scrap" (that is, bits of
soap that 
can no longer be made into soap bars and will have to be thrown away).  

The data are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/soap.txt).



(a) Read the data into R again.



(b) Obtain a histogram of the `scrap` values, using 10
bins for your histogram.
 


(c) Comment briefly on the shape of the histogram. Is it approximately
symmetric, skewed to the left, skewed to the right or something else? (By "comment  briefly" I mean "say in a few words why you gave the answer you did.")



(d) Make side-by-side boxplots of scrap values for each
production line.



(e) Do you think your boxplot says that there are differences in the
amount of scrap produced by the two production lines, or not?
Explain briefly.



(f) We started out with the suspicion that if the line was run
faster, there would be more scrap. We haven't assessed this
yet. Draw a scatter plot with `scrap` on the $y$ axis and
`speed` on the $x$ axis. 



(g) What do you think is the most important conclusion from
your plot of the previous part? Describe your conclusion in the
context of the data.
