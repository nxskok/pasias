##  Air conditioning failures: bootstrapping the median


 With a skewed data distribution such as the air-conditioning
failure times, we might be interested in inference for the median. One
way to get a confidence interval for the median is to invert the sign
test, as in `smmr`, but another way is to obtain a bootstrap
sampling distribution for the median. How do these approaches compare
for the air-conditioning data? We explore this here.



(a) Read in the air-conditioning data again (if you don't already
have it lying around). The link is in the previous question.

Solution


```{r }
my_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/pasias/master/air_conditioning.csv"
aircon <- read_csv(my_url)
aircon
```

     


(b) Use `smmr` to get a confidence interval for the median (based on the sign test).

Solution


Input to `ci_median` is data frame and column:
```{r }
ci_median(aircon, hours)
```

     


(c) Obtain the bootstrap distribution of the sample median. Make a normal quantile plot of it. What do you notice? Explain briefly.

Solution


The usual do-it-yourself bootstrap:

```{r }
tibble(sim = 1:1000) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(samples = list(sample(aircon$hours, replace = TRUE))) %>% 
  mutate(medians = median(samples)) -> meds
```

 

I actually copied and pasted my code from the previous problem, changing `mean` to `median`.

As for a plot, well, this:

```{r }
ggplot(meds, aes(sample = medians)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```

 

Not only does this not look very normal, but also there are those
curious horizontal patches of points (that, you might recall, are
characteristic of a discrete distribution). This has happened because
there are only a few possible medians: the median has to be either a
data value or halfway between two data values, so there are only
something like $2(12)-1=23$ different possible medians, with the ones
in the middle being more likely.

This also shows up on a histogram, but only if you have enough
bins. (If you don't have enough bins, some of the neighbouring
possible values end up in the same bin; here, the aim is to have
enough bins to show the discreteness, rather than the usual thing of
having few enough bins to show the shape.)

```{r }
ggplot(meds, aes(x = medians)) + geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```

 


(d) Obtain a 95\% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the median. How does it compare with the one you obtained earlier?

Solution


Also, the usual:

```{r }
quantile(meds$medians, c(0.025, 0.975))
```

 

This goes down and up not quite so far as the interval from `smmr`. That might be because the `smmr` interval is too wide (based on a not-very-powerful test), or because the bootstrap quantile interval is too narrow (as it usually is). It's hard to tell which it is.


(e) Obtain a 95\% BCa interval. Compare it with the two other intervals you found.

Solution


Yet more copying and pasting (from the previous question):
```{r }
theta <- function(x) {
  median(x)
}
bca_all <- with(aircon, bcanon(hours, 1000, theta))
bca <- bca_all$confpoints
bca
```

     

Again, I seem to need to define the tiny function, while you can probably call `bcanon(hours, 1000, median)`. Try it and see.

My BCa interval is a little longer than the bootstrap percentile
interval and a little shorter than the one that came from the sign
test. I would guess that the BCa interval is the most trustworthy of
the three, though there is here not that much difference between
them. All the intervals are again very long, a reflection of the small
sample size and large variability.
