##  Treating hay fever


 Hay fever is an allergic reaction to things like grasses or
pollen which can make it unpleasant to go outside when the weather is
at its best.  A research lab is developing a new compound to relieve
severe cases of hay fever. There were two active ingredients, labelled
A and B, with each one having three levels, low, medium and
high. There were thus $3\times 3=9$ treatment combinations. 36
subjects were available, and these were randomly assigned to
combinations of levels of factor A and factor B, so that each
combination was tested on 4 people. The response variable was the
number of hours of relief from symptoms (so a higher value is
better). The data are in

(a) Read the data and display its structure. Verify that you
have what you were expecting.


(b) Calculate the mean hours of relief for each combination of
levels of the two active ingredients. Save your results in a data
frame and display that.


(c) Make an interaction plot, showing how the mean pain relief depends on the combination of levels of A and B. It is probably easiest to use the data frame you obtained in the previous part.


(d) What do you conclude from your interaction plot? Explain briefly.


(e) Run an analysis of variance with interaction. What do you conclude?


(f) Analyze the simple effects of B when A is
`medium`. (This means doing an appropriate `aov` and
an appropriate Tukey, if warranted.)


(g) Analyze the simple effects of B when A is `high`.
