##  Location, species and disease in plants


 The table below is a "contingency table", showing
frequencies of diseased and undiseased plants of two different species
in two different locations:


```

Species     Disease present         Disease absent
Location X Location Y  Location X Location Y
A            44         12          38        10
B            28         22          20        18

```


The data were saved as
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/disease.txt). In that
file, the columns are coded by two letters: a `p` or an
`a` to denote presence or absence of disease, and an `x`
or a `y` to denote location X or Y. The data are separated by
multiple spaces and aligned with the variable names. 



(a) Read in and display the data.



(b) Explain briefly how these data are not "tidy".



(c) Use a suitable `tidyr` tool to get all the things
that are the same into a single column. (You'll need to make up a
temporary name for the other new column that you create.) Show your
result. 



(d) Explain briefly how the data frame you just created is
still not "tidy" yet.



(e) Use one more `tidyr` tool to make these data tidy,
and show your result.



(f) Let's see if we can re-construct the original contingency
table (or something equivalent to it). Use the function
`xtabs`. This requires first a model formula with the frequency
variable on the left of the squiggle, and the other variables
separated by plus signs on the right. Second it requires a data
frame, with `data=`. Feed
your data frame from the previous part into `xtabs`. Save the
result in a variable and display the result.



(g) Take the output from the last part and feed it into the
function `ftable`. How has the output been changed? Which do
you like better? Explain briefly.
