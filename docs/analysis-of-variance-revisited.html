<div id="acid-rain" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.1</span> Acid rain</h2>
<p>One of the first noticeable effects of climate change was
“acid rain”. This is formed by the water vapour in clouds combining
with nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, which come from coal and oil
production. How does the acidity of rain affect the acidity of the
soil on which it falls? (This will have an effect on the kind of
plants that can be grown in that soil.) Acidity is measured using the
pH scale, where a pH of 7 is chemically neutral, a number less than 7
is acidic, and a number greater than 7 is alkaline.</p>
<p>An experiment was conducted at the Florida Institute of Food and
Agricultural Sciences, to determine how acidity of rain affects soil
acidity. Experimental plots were irrigated with rainwater that was
prepared to have one of two different pH levels, 3.7 and 4.5. The
acidity of the soil was then measured at three different depths,
0–15, 15–30, and 30–46 centimetres. This was done on three
different dates, in April and June 1991. The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/acidrain.csv">link</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.2</span> Treating hay fever</h2>
<p>Hay fever is an allergic reaction to things like grasses or
pollen which can make it unpleasant to go outside when the weather is
at its best. A research lab is developing a new compound to relieve
severe cases of hay fever. There were two active ingredients, labelled
A and B, with each one having three levels, low, medium and
high. There were thus <span class="math inline">\(3\times 3=9\)</span> treatment combinations. 36
subjects were available, and these were randomly assigned to
combinations of levels of factor A and factor B, so that each
combination was tested on 4 people. The response variable was the
number of hours of relief from symptoms (so a higher value is
better). The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/hayfever.txt">link</a>.</p>

<div id="focused-comparisons-of-the-effect-of-caffeine" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.3</span> Focused comparisons of the effect of caffeine</h2>
<p>Does caffeine help students do better on a certain test? To
find out, 36 students were randomly allocated to three groups (12 in
each group). Each student received a fixed number of cups of coffee
while they were studying, but the students didn’t know whether they
were receiving all full-strength coffee (“high”), all decaf coffee
(“low”) or a 50-50 mixture of the two (“moderate”). For each
subject, their group was recorded as well as their score on the
test. The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv">link</a>, as a
<code>.csv</code> file.</p>
<p>This time we look at
contrasts. Suppose I knew ahead of time
that I wanted to compare moderate caffeine with high, and any
caffeine with none. (In the latter case, we’re comparing
“no caffeine” against the average of the other two groups.)</p>
<p>In the previous go-through of the caffeine data, we
discovered that <code>amount</code> was actually text rather than a
factor, but we also discovered that it <em>didn’t matter</em>. Here it
does matter, so the first thing we have to do is to re-do the
<code>pivot_longer</code>, creating a factor version of <code>amount</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Read in the data again, from
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv">link</a>, and
display it. This is the untidy format, so name it appropriately:</p></li>
<li><p>Copy your <code>pivot_longer</code> from before, only this time add
<code>names_ptypes = list(amount=factor())</code> to the end of it. Take a look at the
results. What has changed from before?</p></li>
<li><p>Using the newly tidied caffeine data, run the ANOVA
<em>as a regression</em> (that is, using <code>lm</code>). Look at the
<code>summary</code> of the output. What do you see?</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain the different values of <code>amount</code>, in the order
that R has them.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a contrast that compares High with Moderate, ignoring
None. That is, create a vector whose length is the same as the
number of levels of <code>amount</code>, and which has a 1 to represent
High and a <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> to represent Moderate.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a contrast that compares “any caffeine” against
“none” by comparing None against the average of Moderate and High.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrange your contrasts as columns of a matrix (using
<code>cbind</code>), and say that you want to use these as contrasts for
<code>amount</code> (in data frame <code>caffeine</code> or whatever you
called it).</p></li>

<code>summary</code>. What do you conclude about your contrasts?</p></li>

<p>A social scientist wanted to see how many hours students
studied outside of class. She took a random sample of 75 students

recorded the number of weekly outside-class study hours for each
student. The data can be found at
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/studyhours.txt">link</a>. The

<div id="mental-context" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.5</span> Mental context</h2>
<p>It is believed that being in the same mental context for
learning and for testing leads to better test scores. An experiment
was carried out to test this. During the learning phase, subjects
learned a list of 80 words in a room painted orange and decorated with
posters, paintings and other paraphernalia.
<label for="tufte-mn-210" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-210" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">This is a fancy word for <em>stuff</em>.</span> A memory test was given to all subjects
immediately after they had learned the words, to give the impression
that the experiment was over. (The results of this test were
discarded.) One day later, subjects were unexpectedly re-tested under
different experimental conditions and asked to write down all the
words of the original list that they could remember. The re-test took
place in five different conditions, which subjects were randomly
allocated to one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Same context: in the original orange-painted room.</p></li>
<li><p>Different context: in a very different room, painted grey and
located in a different part of campus.</p></li>
<li><p>Imaginary context: in the grey room, but subjects are asked to
remember the orange room in which they took the original test. To
help them with this, the experimenter begins by asking them several
questions about the orange room and the objects in it.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.6</span> Trying on shirts</h2>
<p>Does it make a difference if you see somebody else trying on
a shirt before you do, and if so, does it matter what kind of person
it is?</p>
<p>An experiment was carried out in a university bookstore, with
students who wanted to try on a shirt serving as (unsuspecting)
experimental subjects. When a student wanted to try on a shirt, the
sales associate told them that there was only one shirt left, and it
was being tried on by an “other customer”. This “other customer”
was actually a “confederate” of the experimenter (that means, they
were pretending to be a real customer but were actually part of the
experiment). The “other customer” was always female: either an
attractive well-dressed model, or an average-looking student wearing
jeans. The “other customer” would come out of the
dressing room and hand the shirt to the sales associate, who would
give it to the student who wanted to try it on. When the student had
tried on the shirt, they were asked to rate it on a 7-point scale (on
five different dimensions, and those five scores were then
averaged). Does a student’s evaluation depend on whether the student
was male or female, and whether the “other customer” was a model or
a student? There was also a control group, where the student was
handed the shirt directly by the sales associate, without the
“other customer” being involved at all.</p>
<p>There were thus five treatments:
male students who saw a model, male students who saw a student, female
students who saw a model, female students who saw a student, and the
control group. There were 25 students in each treatment group.</p>

<div id="acid-rain-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.7</span> Acid rain</h2>
<p>One of the first noticeable effects of climate change was
“acid rain”. This is formed by the water vapour in clouds combining
with nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, which come from coal and oil
production. How does the acidity of rain affect the acidity of the
soil on which it falls? (This will have an effect on the kind of
plants that can be grown in that soil.) Acidity is measured using the
pH scale, where a pH of 7 is chemically neutral, a number less than 7
is acidic, and a number greater than 7 is alkaline.</p>
<p>An experiment was conducted at the Florida Institute of Food and
Agricultural Sciences, to determine how acidity of rain affects soil
acidity. Experimental plots were irrigated with rainwater that was
prepared to have one of two different pH levels, 3.7 and 4.5. The
acidity of the soil was then measured at three different depths,
0–15, 15–30, and 30–46 centimetres. This was done on three
different dates, in April and June 1991. The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/acidrain.csv">link</a>.</p>

<p>There are 4 columns, soil depth, date, pH of the rain that was
applied (all explanatory) and soil acidity, the response. You’ll note
that we have one soil acidity value per combination of the other
things (it was a designed experiment).</p>
<p>We’re going to ignore the date for now, treating the observations on
different dates as replicates.</p>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Draw a grouped boxplot to show how soil acidity depends on
the pH of the rain and the soil depth. (The first time you do this
you might not get the boxplot you want. How can you fix that?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The problem is likely to be that either your <code>x</code> or your
<code>fill</code> for your boxplot is numerical (<code>rain_pH</code> is
<code>dbl</code>) rather than the categorical variable you need.
Try to use one of the explanatory variables as <code>x</code> and the other
one as <code>fill</code> (or <code>colour</code>):</p>

<p>That looks as if it worked, but it didn’t. See the boxplot below for
how it’s supposed to be. I need <code>x</code> for the boxplot needs to
be categorical. The easiest way to make it such is to wrap it in
<code>factor</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2352"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2352-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(acidrain, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> <span class="kw">factor</span>(rain_pH), <span class="dt">y =</span> soil_acidity, <span class="dt">fill =</span> soil_depth)) <span class="op">+</span></a>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What does your grouped boxplot say about likely
interactions? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Think about the effect of one of your explanatory variables, for
each level of the other. For example, in the last plot, the effect
of the rain pH pm on the soil acidity is very small at the largest
and smallest depths, but at the middle soil depth 15–30, the
average (median) soil acidity is a lot less when the rain pH is
<em>higher</em> (which seems odd to me). The effect of rain pH being
different according to soil pH is what suggests an interaction
effect.
Another way of thinking about this is imagining what an
interaction plot would look like. This would be a trace going
through the middle (strictly, mean rather than median) of each set
of boxplots of one colour. In the last boxplot, the red trace
would go close to straight across, while the blue one would dip in
the middle. Not parallel, so suggesting an interaction.
Either approach is good.</p>

<p>The interaction is nowhere near significant, perhaps surprisingly. But

<li>Make an interaction plot, showing how the mean pain relief depends on the combination of levels of A and B. It is probably easiest to use the data frame you obtained in the previous part.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>My column of mean relief values is called <code>m</code>. Use whatever
name you gave it. I’m going to use my proper-order data frame for
this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2367"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2367-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(d2, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> a, <span class="dt">y =</span> m, <span class="dt">colour =</span> b, <span class="dt">group =</span> b)) <span class="op">+</span></a>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1528-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Or, you probably had this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2368"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2368-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(d, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> a, <span class="dt">y =</span> m, <span class="dt">colour =</span> b, <span class="dt">group =</span> b)) <span class="op">+</span></a>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1529-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Since <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> both have three levels, you could just as well use them the other way around:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2369"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2369-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(d2, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> b, <span class="dt">y =</span> m, <span class="dt">colour =</span> a, <span class="dt">group =</span> a)) <span class="op">+</span></a>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1530-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The plot looks different depending on how you draw it, but the
conclusion from it (below) will be the same.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What do you conclude from your interaction plot? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The three lines are not particularly close to being parallel, so I
would expect to see an interaction between the two active
ingredients (that is, the number of hours of pain relief depends
on the combination of the two of them).</p>
<p>Extra: It is always a judgment call to decide whether the lines
are “approximately parallel” or not. It depends on how much
variability there is in the data, which the interaction plot
doesn’t show. Another idea is to add the data to the interaction
plot, colour-coded in the same way. I would do this by taking out
the <code>geom_point</code> for the means and add one instead for the
data, taken from the original data frame:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2370"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2370-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(d2, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> a, <span class="dt">y =</span> m, <span class="dt">colour =</span> b, <span class="dt">group =</span> b)) <span class="op">+</span></a>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1531-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Technique: for that last <code>geom_point</code>, put in anything that
changes: a new data frame, and a new <code>y</code> for the plot, but the
<code>x</code> and <code>colour</code> and <code>group</code> are the same as they
were before, so I don’t need to specify them.</p>
<p>The points are <em>very</em> close to the lines, so there is almost no
residual variability. This makes it more convincing that the
interaction is real and will be significant.</p>

<p>The interaction is (strongly) significant. The hours of relief depend on the combination of levels of the active ingredients A and B.</p>

<p>When A is high, there is definitely an effect of B again, but this
time high (for B) is better than medium is better than low. (All the
P-values in Tukey are very small.)</p>
<p>You could guess this from the interaction plot as well (whichever one
you came up with): when A is high, it is better for B to be high as
well, but when A is medium or low, there is not much difference
between B being medium or high.</p>
<p>Extra: here, the effect of B is different, depending on what A is. This is
what a significant interaction <em>means</em>. If there were no
significant interaction, the effect of B would always be the same, no
matter what A was.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.9</span> Focused comparisons of the effect of caffeine</h2>
<p>Does caffeine help students do better on a certain test? To
find out, 36 students were randomly allocated to three groups (12 in
each group). Each student received a fixed number of cups of coffee
while they were studying, but the students didn’t know whether they
were receiving all full-strength coffee (“high”), all decaf coffee
(“low”) or a 50-50 mixture of the two (“moderate”). For each
subject, their group was recorded as well as their score on the
test. The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv">link</a>, as a
<code>.csv</code> file.</p>
<p>This time we look at
contrasts. Suppose I knew ahead of time
that I wanted to compare moderate caffeine with high, and any
caffeine with none. (In the latter case, we’re comparing
“no caffeine” against the average of the other two groups.)</p>
<p>In the previous go-through of the caffeine data, we
discovered that <code>amount</code> was actually text rather than a
factor, but we also discovered that it <em>didn’t matter</em>. Here it
does matter, so the first thing we have to do is to re-do the
<code>pivot_longer</code>, creating a factor version of <code>amount</code>.</p>

<p>Look at the slopes. They are <code>amount</code> followed by one of the
amounts of caffeine. R is using “high” as a baseline (that’s the
first level alphabetically), so the
<code>amountModerate</code> line is testing high vs. moderate: high is
<em>not</em> significantly higher, in terms of test scores, than
moderate. That’s one of the things I wanted to test. What about the
coefficient for <code>amountNone</code>? That’s none vs. <em>high</em>,
since high was the baseline. This is, as we saw from Tukey,
significant. But it is not what I said we wanted to test.</p>
<p>Extra: in case you’re curious, you can also get the regular analysis of
variance table as below. <code>anova</code> is multi-talented:</p>

<p>The problem is that you can’t naturally do Tukey this way, which is

are focusing in on the two contrasts that we really wanted to test,

<p>The best
description I have seen of what to do here is by David Howell,
<label for="tufte-mn-213" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-213" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Howell is the author of a famous text on Statistics in Psychology.</span> at
<a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~dhowell/StatPages/More_Stuff/R/AnovaOneway.html">link</a>
(at the bottom).
Let
me try to follow his method.</p>
<p>First we need a vector that is all 1’s, which I have called
<code>c0</code> below. Since each of our contrasts <code>c.hm</code> and
<code>c.mn</code> have 3 things in them (3 groups), we need to add a
“dummy” 3rd contrast to give us a <span class="math inline">\(3\times 3\)</span> array of numbers:
<label for="tufte-mn-214" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-214" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">which we are going to invert, as a matrix. But I get ahead of myself.</span></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2414"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2414-1" title="1">c0 &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2414-2" title="2">m &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">cbind</span>(c0, c.hm, c.mn)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2414-3" title="3">m</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##      c0 c.hm c.mn
## [1,]  1    1    0
## [2,]  1   -1    1
## [3,]  1    0   -1</code></pre>
<p>This is what Howell calls an “augmented” matrix of contrasts, since
it has our two contrasts as the second and third columns, plus
the extra dummy one. Next we invert this matrix of contrasts,
which we can do because it’s square. <code>t(m)</code> means
“take the matrix transpose of <code>m</code>”, if you’re trying to keep up at the
back, and <code>solve</code> finds a matrix inverse:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2416"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2416-1" title="1">minv &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">solve</span>(<span class="kw">t</span>(m))</a></code></pre></div>
<p>and then we remove the first column, which represents the contrast
that we didn’t want anyway (what Howell calls “deaugmenting”):
<label for="tufte-mn-215" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-215" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">We are working with R matrices here rather than data frames, so we access elements, rows and columns using the square bracket notation: inside the square brackets, we put first the numbers of the rows we want, then a comma, then the numbers of the columns. There are two special pieces of notation, both of which I use here: leaving the row or column slot blank means all the rows or all the columns, and using a negative row or column number means all the rows or columns except the one(s) named. Thus my notation here is all the rows, and all the columns except for the first one. You can access data frames this way too, but the Tidyverse makes it much easier.</span></p>

<p>The rows <code>amountc.hm</code> and <code>amountc.mn</code> are the proper tests
for our contrasts <code>c.hm</code> and <code>c.mn</code>.
<code>c.hm</code> is not significant (P-value 0.14) and
<code>c.mn</code> is not significant either
(P-value 0.20). This is the same significance as from Tukey, but note
that the P-values for the non-significant tests are much lower than
the corresponding ones from Tukey, once again because we have focused
on just these comparisons, and not on any others. We decided ahead of
time to test just these, and gave ourselves the best chance of finding
significance that we could.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.10</span> Who studies the most outside class?</h2>
<p>A social scientist wanted to see how many hours students
studied outside of class. She took a random sample of 75 students
from three different majors: math, social science and English, and
recorded the number of weekly outside-class study hours for each
student. The data can be found at
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/studyhours.txt">link</a>. The
social scientist had two research questions: whether math students study
more outside of class than the other students, and whether English and
social science students study different amounts of time outside class.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Explain briefly why contrasts would be a better idea here

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The researcher is not interested in all the comparisons between
the groups, but rather in two specific ones (as detailed in the
question). So we should focus our attention on those
comparisons. This is what contrasts are for.</p>

<p>This suggests that the math students study more than the others, but
the English and social science students study about the same amount.</p>
<p>I see some rather consistent right-skewness here (but no outliers). We
have 25 observations in each group, a decent amount of data, so I’m
not too worried, but a transformation could be a good idea, something
like square root, perhaps. The spreads are not that unequal, but it
<em>is</em> true that the Math students have both the largest median
<em>and</em> the largest spread, and the social science students are the
lowest on both.</p>
<p>Extra: Box-Cox also works on ANOVA-type data, since that is an <code>lm</code>
kind of model:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2426"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2426-1" title="1"><span class="kw">boxcox</span>(hours <span class="op">~</span><span class="st"> </span>major, <span class="dt">data =</span> studyhours)</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1561-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This suggests that some kind of transformation would be a good idea
(no transformation, power 1, is not supported by the data). My guess
of 0.5 is not bad; that, or something a bit less like 0.25 (fourth
root) would be good. Even log is supportable. But we’ll proceed
without transformation in this question to give you some practice with
contrasts. Despite appearances, I do (sometimes) like to make things
not so complicated!</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Set up contrasts for each of the researcher’s research
questions, bearing in mind the levels of <code>major</code> and the
order in which they come. (For the <code>Math</code> contrast, you want
Math against the average of the other two.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>We need to know what the categories of <code>major</code> are, so that
we can set up the contrasts correctly, so let’s start with that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2427"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2427-1" title="1">studyhours <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">select</span>(major) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">summary</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##     major          
##  Length:75         
##  Class :character  
##  Mode  :character</code></pre>
<p>Oh. Yeah. We never turned <code>major</code> into a factor. We’d better do
that, and then try again:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2429"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2429-1" title="1">studyhours &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>studyhours <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(<span class="dt">major =</span> <span class="kw">factor</span>(major))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2429-2" title="2">studyhours <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">select</span>(major) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">summary</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##      major   
##  english:25  
##  math   :25  
##  socsci :25</code></pre>
<p>In alphabetical order.</p>
<p>All right, contrasts. The English vs. social science one is easier,
so we’ll do that first. Just set it up with a 1 for one of them and a
<span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> for the other and 0 for math, in the right order according to
what the levels are, viz:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2431"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2431-1" title="1">c.eng.socsci &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">-1</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Or <code>c(-1,0,1)</code> would be just as good.</p>
<p>The other one is a bit trickier, because you want math against the
average of the others, like
<span class="math display">\[\mbox{math}-(\mbox{English}+\mbox{socsci})/2.\]</span>
This translates into contrast-ese like this, making sure to get Math
in the middle where it belongs:
<label for="tufte-mn-216" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-216" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">As I failed to do the first time.</span></p>

<p>The coefficients have to add up to zero, so I have to have two halves
to balance my one 1. Or I can use two <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>s and a 2.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Multiply them together (elementwise, which is how R does it)
and show that what you get adds up to zero:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2433"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2433-1" title="1"><span class="kw">sum</span>(c.eng.socsci <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span>c.math.others)</a></code></pre></div>

<p>There is a seriously significant difference between the math students

the mean study hours of the English and social science students.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Are you surprised by the significance or non-significance you

<p>Solution</p>
<p>Go back and compare with the boxplots. The math students
studied noticeably more than the others, so it is not
surprising that this difference came out significant. The
median study times for the English and social science students
were similar, so it is not at all surprising that this difference
failed to be significant.</p>
<p>When you set up contrasts, <em>these</em> are the tests you are
interested in, so there is no reason for following up with
Tukey or anything else. But you have to be able to say ahead of
time which contrasts you want to test. This is in
contrast

which comparisons interest you until right at the end.</p>
<p>Another question you might have had is
“how many contrasts can I do”? To answer this, go back and look at the ANOVA table. If
you run an ANOVA using <code>lm</code>, you get the ANOVA table by

<p>The two P-values are identical, but the second one is not now
identified with any contrast (so we just ignore it). If we were only
interested in how math students compared with the rest, we could test
it this way.</p>
<p>Or, we could relabel the students as “math” and “other” and just
do a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. To do this, we need to delve into
<code>forcats</code> (which is a part of the <code>tidyverse</code>). It deals
with categorical variables which are genuine factors, which we haven’t
had much cause to do so far. But now we do. What we want to do is to
<em>recode</em> the levels of <code>major</code>, which is done by
<code>fct_recode</code>:</p>

<p>The way <code>fct_recode</code> works is that you first give a factor,
here <code>major</code>, then you define a list of new levels in terms of
the old ones. We want a student whose major is either English or
Social Science to end up in the new not-math group that we’ll call
<code>rest</code>, so we need two lines inside <code>fct_recode</code>, one
that says that the new <code>rest</code> group includes the old
<code>english</code> majors, and another that says that <code>rest</code> also
includes the old <code>socsci</code> majors. Any levels not mentioned
(here <code>math</code>) are left unchanged.</p>
<p>I did this wrong the first time: I got the things before and after the
<code>=</code> in <code>fct_recode</code> the wrong way around.</p>
<p>The last line is to check that the result makes sense. I previously
had 25 students in each major. Now I have 25 students for whom
<code>mathrest</code> is <code>math</code> (the math majors) and <span class="math inline">\(50=25+25\)</span>
students for whom <code>mathrest</code> is <code>rest</code> (everyone else).</p>
<p>Now, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test.</p>

<p>This is very close to, but not the same as, the test with the contrasts,
because we are not quite testing the same thing. Here, we are
comparing the mean of the math students to the mean of everyone else,
thrown together into one big bag, but with the contrasts, we are
comparing the mean of the math students with the  of the other two groups, treating them as different. (Not
clear? Well, it’s not that clear to me either.)</p>
<p>That business with the <code>var.equal=T</code>? This is doing a pooled
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. I did that here because the ANOVA is assuming equal spreads
within the groups (which is what a pooled <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test does) and I thought
I should do my best to be consistent. A pooled <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is really a
two-group one-way ANOVA, or at least it is if it is done two-sided.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.11</span> Mental context</h2>
<p>It is believed that being in the same mental context for
learning and for testing leads to better test scores. An experiment
was carried out to test this. During the learning phase, subjects
learned a list of 80 words in a room painted orange and decorated with
posters, paintings and other paraphernalia.
<label for="tufte-mn-220" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-220" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">This is a fancy word for <em>stuff</em>.</span> A memory test was given to all subjects
immediately after they had learned the words, to give the impression
that the experiment was over. (The results of this test were
discarded.) One day later, subjects were unexpectedly re-tested under
different experimental conditions and asked to write down all the
words of the original list that they could remember. The re-test took
place in five different conditions, which subjects were randomly
allocated to one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Same context: in the original orange-painted room.</p></li>
<li><p>Different context: in a very different room, painted grey and
located in a different part of campus.</p></li>
<li><p>Imaginary context: in the grey room, but subjects are asked to
remember the orange room in which they took the original test. To
help them with this, the experimenter begins by asking them several
questions about the orange room and the objects in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Photographed context: in the grey room, but subjects are shown
photographs of the orange room.</p></li>
<li><p>Placebo context: in the grey room, with subjects first being
asked to recall their living room.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, the response variable was the number of words on the
original list successfully recalled by each subject.</p>
<p>50 subjects in total completed the experiment, 10 under each of the 5
conditions.</p>
<p>The researchers had four research hypotheses to test with the data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Groups where the context matches (is the same, or is simulated
by imagining or photograph) will perform better than groups with
different or placebo contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>The group with the same context will differ from the group with
imaginary or photographed contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>The imaginary-context group will differ from the
photographed-context group.</p></li>
<li><p>The different-context group will differ from the placebo-context group.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The research hypotheses are (as is usual) written as
<em>alternative</em> hypotheses. We can rewrite them as null
hypotheses, with some extra wording to facilitate converting them
into contrasts, like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mean of the <code>same</code>, <code>imaginary</code> and
<code>photograph</code> groups (group means) is equal to the mean of the
<code>different</code> and <code>placebo</code> groups (group means).</p></li>
<li><p>The mean of the <code>imaginary</code> and <code>photograph</code>
groups is equal to the (mean of the) <code>same</code> group.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>imaginary</code> and the <code>photograph</code> groups will
have the same mean.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>different</code> and the <code>placebo</code> groups will
have the same mean.</p></li>

<p>Or treat <code>context</code> as text, such as this way:</p>

<p>These all display the contexts in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>These two <em>don’t</em> display things in alphabetical order, because
they display things as they appear in the file. This is not the order
we want, though the second way <em>does</em> display the <code>Levels</code>

<p>Variations: you can switch the sign on everything within a
contrast (since it doesn’t matter which is plus and which is
minus). You can also multiply through by anything to get rid of

<p>Slipping off into another aside, you might have been wondering whether
there was a way to test
<em>all</em> the contrasts for orthogonality at once. There is, and it
depends on the rules for matrix multiplication. We want to test all
the <em>columns</em> of <code>m</code> for orthogonality, but matrix
multiplication works by combining a <em>row</em> with a column. No
matter, <em>transposing</em> a matrix interchanges rows and columns, so
that in math, we want to look at the matrix <span class="math inline">\(M^T M\)</span>. In R,
<code>%*%</code> means “matrix multiply”.

<p>This matrix-multiplies the transpose of <code>m</code> by <code>m</code>

but don’t worry about these, since a contrast doesn’t have to be

<li>For each of the original research hypotheses, what do you
infer about them?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Even though I generated the contrasts backwards, I maintained
the numbering so that they refer to the original numbered
hypotheses. You might have named them something more mnemonic;
that works too, and is quite possibly better.
Anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Matching context better than non-matching context:
strongly significant (P-value 0.000085). (Strictly, this is a
two-sided test, but the way I constructed the contrast, this
should be significantly <em>positive</em> if the research
hypothesis is true, and it is.)</p></li>
<li><p>Same context <em>not</em> different from
imaginary/photographed context (P-value 0.823)</p></li>
<li><p>Imaginary context <em>not</em> different from photographed context (P-value 0.938).</p></li>
<li><p>Different context <em>not</em> different from placebo
context (P-value 0.699).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted you to match up the research hypotheses with the
P-values, as above, and state a conclusion about each one. If
you do that, I am happy.</p>
<p>Taking this back to the original research, I think the
first hypothesis was the most immediately important of the four:
we were able to show that having (or faking up) the original
room helped with recall. After that, it didn’t matter how it was
done: being in the original room was not different from
imagining the original room (by thinking about it or seeing a
photo of it). Failing to recall the original room was equally
bad, whether the subjects were in a different room and not asked
to think about the original orange room, or whether they were
literally asked to think about another room entirely.</p>
<p>Contrasts enabled us to tackle this problem and gain a very clear
conclusion: recalling the original orange room is helpful, but
it doesn’t matter how you do it.</p>
<p>How big of a difference does thinking about the orange room
make? You can use the 2 SE thing to get a 95% confidence interval:
the difference in the (mean of the) recall-orange-room means and
the (mean of the) don’t-recall means is between about 4.6 and
12.6 words (out of 80). I leave it for you to decide whether
that is practically important as well as being statistically significant.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">34.12</span> Trying on shirts</h2>
<p>Does it make a difference if you see somebody else trying on
a shirt before you do, and if so, does it matter what kind of person
it is?</p>
<p>An experiment was carried out in a university bookstore, with
students who wanted to try on a shirt serving as (unsuspecting)
experimental subjects. When a student wanted to try on a shirt, the
sales associate told them that there was only one shirt left, and it
was being tried on by an “other customer”. This “other customer”
was actually a “confederate” of the experimenter (that means, they
were pretending to be a real customer but were actually part of the
experiment). The “other customer” was always female: either an
attractive well-dressed model, or an average-looking student wearing
jeans. The “other customer” would come out of the
dressing room and hand the shirt to the sales associate, who would
give it to the student who wanted to try it on. When the student had
tried on the shirt, they were asked to rate it on a 7-point scale (on
five different dimensions, and those five scores were then
averaged). Does a student’s evaluation depend on whether the student
was male or female, and whether the “other customer” was a model or
a student? There was also a control group, where the student was
handed the shirt directly by the sales associate, without the
“other customer” being involved at all.</p>
<p>There were thus five treatments:
male students who saw a model, male students who saw a student, female
students who saw a model, female students who saw a student, and the
control group. There were 25 students in each treatment group.</p>

<p>except that <code>distinct</code> shows you the values in the order that
they appear in the data file, which is <em>not</em> the order that they
appear in the factor. So that’s why I asked you not to do it that way.</p>
<p>Alphabetical order, is the moral of the story.</p>

if you want to (and if you know what you are doing):</p>

<p><code>fct_inorder</code> <em>creates</em> a factor whose levels are in the

can go ahead and do this, and use this order when you create your

<p>Ah, it respects the order of the levels of the factor: that is to say,
the treatment groups appear here in the order that they were in the
data, because the factor <code>trt2</code> was created to make that
happen.</p>
<p><code>forcats</code> has other tools to re-order the levels of a factor,
lump factor levels together to make a category “other”, and so
on. These also work if you start with a categorical variable as text:
it <em>creates</em> a factor with those properties.</p>

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The experimenters wanted to compare four specific things in
their analysis:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>evaluation scores between male students who saw a (female) model and
male students who saw a (female) student</p></li>
<li><p>evaluation scores between female students who saw a (female)

<p>Create contrasts, with suitable names, using vectors with
appropriate values.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>These, in that order, are comparisons of treatments 4 and 5:</p>

<p>(in these two the 1 and <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> can also be the other way around)</p>
<p>the average of 2 and 3 vs. the average of 4 and 5:</p>

<p>or you can use 1 and <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> instead of the 0.5s, or you can switch the

<li>Collect all your contrasts together into a matrix and

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I called my data frame <code>shirts</code>, so I need to do this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2493"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2493-1" title="1">m &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">cbind</span>(c_mms, c_fms, c_mf, c_tc)</a>

<p>There’s no output here; we’ll see in a moment whether it worked.</p>
<p>Extra: once you’ve created the matrix <code>m</code>, it gives you a
second way to test the contrasts for orthogonality, all at once:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2494"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2494-1" title="1"><span class="kw">t</span>(m) <span class="op">%*%</span><span class="st"> </span>m</a></code></pre></div>

## c_fms     0     2    0 0.00
## c_mf      0     0    1 0.00
## c_tc      0     0    0 1.25</code></pre>
<p>This matrix-multiplies the transpose of <code>m</code> by <code>m</code>, so
it’s testing each column of <code>m</code> to see whether it’s orthogonal
to each other column. The columns don’t have to be orthogonal to
themselves, hence the non-zeros down the diagonal, but all the
off-diagonal entries are zero. Hence each contrast is orthogonal to
each other contrast.</p>
<p>Or even:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2496"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2496-1" title="1">z &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">t</span>(m) <span class="op">%*%</span><span class="st"> </span>m</a>

<p>That says (a little breathlessly) that it is true that all the

<p>Note how the contrasts have appeared as “slopes” in our
regression. (If this didn’t happen for you, go back and check what you
did. Probably something gave you an error before, in that case.)</p>
<p>Your slopes can differ in terms of sign and possibly value from mine,
but the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistics and P-values should be the same as mine.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>For each of your contrasts, assess whether or not it is
significant, and explain briefly what that means in the context of the
data. If a contrast is significant, use your answer to
part (<a href="#part:mean-eval">here</a>) to help in your interpretation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I’ll take my four contrasts as they appear in the output from <code>lm</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Comparing the male students who saw the model with those
who saw the student: this is strongly significant, and the
table of means shows that the males who saw the model rated
the shirt significantly <em>higher</em> than those who saw the
“average-looking” female student.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparing the female students who saw the model with
those who saw the student: this difference is not quite
significant, so we conclude that it didn’t matter who the
female students saw coming out of the dressing room.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a significant difference between the average
evaluation score that males gave to the shirt and that
females did. The table of means reveals that the male
average was higher, mostly because males <em>really</em> liked
the shirt when they thought the model had been wearing it!</p></li>
<li><p>There is no significant difference overall between
treatment and control groups in terms of average
score. (This is mostly because the treatment groups differ
among themselves, with the scores for students who saw the
model being higher and those for students who saw the female
student being lower than for the control group.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is enough, on the non-significant ones, to say what it is
that the contrast is testing, and then to note that it is not
significant. On the significant ones, I want you to say what
is higher than what.
You can also get these conclusions from the <code>lm</code>
output, but it requires a bit more care:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I set up <code>c_mms</code> with the score for the students
who had seen the model as plus and those who saw the student
as minus. My slope here is positive, so the score for
male students who saw the model is higher.</p></li>
<li><p>My slope for <code>c_fms</code> is also positive, and I set
this one up the same way with model as positive and student
as negative, so the female students rated the shirt higher
(but not significantly higher) when they saw the model.</p></li>
<li><p>My <code>c_mf</code> slope is significantly negative. I set
up this contrast with females as plus and males as minus, so
this means males gave a significantly <em>higher</em> score on
average (for reasons discussed above).</p></li>
<li><p>The last slope is very close to 0, consistent with there
being no difference (on average) between treatment and control.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the story to get from this analysis is that male
students are <em>such</em> suckers!</p>
