<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> North Carolina births</h2>
<p>The data in file
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ncbirths.csv">link</a> are about
500 randomly chosen births of babies in North Carolina. There is a lot
of information: not just the weight at birth of the baby, but whether
the baby was born prematurely, the ages of the parents, whether the
parents are married, how long (in weeks) the pregnancy lasted (this is
called the “gestation”) and so on.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Read in the data from the file into R, bearing in mind what
type of file it is.</p></li>
<li><p>From your output, verify that you have the
right number of observations and that you have several
variables. Which of your variables correspond to birthweight,
prematureness and length of pregnancy? (You might have to make guesses
based on the names of the variables.)</p></li>
<li><p>The theory behind the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test (which we do later) says that the
distribution of birth weights should be (approximately) normally
distributed. Obtain a histogram of the birth weights. Does it look
approximately normal? Comment briefly. (You’ll have to pick a number
of bins for your histogram first. I don’t mind very much what you
pick, as long as it’s not obviously too many or too few bins.)</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>How short does a pregnancy have to be, for the birth to be
classified as “premature”? Deduce this from the data, by drawing a

length of pregancy (“gestation”) using a suitable graph. What do you
see?</p></li>
<li><p>Do a web search to find the standard (North American)
definition of a premature birth. Does that correspond to what you saw

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Nenana, Alaska</h2>
<p>Nenana, Alaska, is about 50 miles west of Fairbanks.
Every spring, there is a contest in Nenana. A wooden tripod is
placed on the frozen river, and people try to guess the exact minute
when the ice melts enough for the tripod to fall through the ice. The
contest started in 1917 as an amusement for railway workers, and has
taken place every year since. Now, hundreds of thousands of people
enter their guesses on the Internet and the prize for the winner can
be as much as $300,000.</p>
<p>Because so much money is at stake, and because the exact same tripod
is placed at the exact same spot on the ice every year, the data are
consistent and accurate. The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/nenana.txt">link</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Read the data into R. Note that the values are
separated by <em>tabs</em> rather than spaces, so you’ll need an
appropriate <code>read_</code> to read it in.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way of displaying how many rows and columns your
data frame has, and some of the values. Describe the first and last
of the variables that
you appear to have.</p></li>
<li><p>Dates and times are awkward to handle with software. (We
see more ways later in the course.) The column <code>JulianDate</code>
expresses the time that the tripod fell through the ice as a
fractional number of days since December 31. This enables the time
(as a fraction of the way through the day) to be recorded as well,
the whole thing being an ordinary number.
Make a histogram of the Julian dates. Comment briefly on its shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot <code>JulianDate</code> against <code>Year</code> on a
scatterplot. What recent trends, if any, do you see? Comment briefly.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Computerized accounting</h2>
<p>Beginning accounting students need to
learn to learn to audit in a computerized environment. A sample of
beginning accounting students took each of two tests: the Computer
Attitude Scale (CAS) and the Computer Anxiety Rating Scale (CARS). A
higher score in each indicates greater anxiety around computers. The test scores are scaled to be between 0 and 5. Also
noted was each student’s gender. The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/compatt.txt">http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/compatt.txt</a>. The data values are separated by spaces.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Unprecendented rainfall</h2>
<p>In 1997, a company in Davis, California, had problems with
odour in its wastewater facility. According to a company official, the
problems were caused by “unprecedented weather conditions” and “because
rainfall was at 170 to 180 percent of its normal level, the water in
the holding ponds took longer to exit for irrigation, giving it more
time to develop an odour.”</p>
<p>Annual rainfall data for the Davis area is <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/rainfall.txt">here</a>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Learning algebra</h2>
<p>At a high school in New Jersey, teachers were interested in what might help students to learn algebra. One idea was laptops as a learning aid, to see whether having access to one helped with algebra scores. (This was some time ago.) The 20 students in one class were given laptops to use in school and at home, while the 27 students in another class were not given laptops. For all of these students, the final exam score in algebra was recorded. The data are in , with two columns, one indicating whether the student received a laptop or not, and the other giving their score on the algebra final exam.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Read in and display (some of) the data. Do you have (i) the correct number of observations, and (ii) the correct <em>type</em> of columns? Explain briefly.</p></li>

<div id="north-carolina-births-1" class="section level2" number="4.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> North Carolina births</h2>
<p>The data in file
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ncbirths.csv">link</a> are about
500 randomly chosen births of babies in North Carolina. There is a lot
of information: not just the weight at birth of the baby, but whether
the baby was born prematurely, the ages of the parents, whether the
parents are married, how long (in weeks) the pregnancy lasted (this is
called the “gestation”) and so on.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Read in the data from the file into R, bearing in mind what
type of file it is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is a <code>.csv</code> file (it came from a spreadsheet), so it
needs reading in accordingly. Work directly from the URL (rather
than downloading the file, unless you are working offline):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb102"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb102-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb102-1"></a>myurl &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ncbirths.csv&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb102-2"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb102-2"></a>bw &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">read_csv</span>(myurl)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## cols(
##   `Father Age` = col_double(),
##   `Mother Age` = col_double(),
##   `Weeks Gestation` = col_double(),
##   `Pre-natal Visits` = col_double(),
##   `Marital Status` = col_double(),
##   `Mother Weight Gained` = col_double(),
##   `Low Birthweight?` = col_double(),
##   `Weight (pounds)` = col_double(),
##   `Premie?` = col_double(),
##   `Few Visits?` = col_double()
## )</code></pre>
<p>This shows you which variables the data set has (some of the names got
a bit mangled), and it shows you that they are all integers except for
the birth weight (a decimal number).</p>
<p>The easiest way to find out how many rows and columns there are is
simply to list the data frame:</p>

<p>Either of these displays show that there are 500 rows (observations,
here births) and 10 columns (variables), and they both show what the
variables are called. So they’re both good as an answer to the
question.</p>
<p>What you’ll notice is that the variables have <em>spaces</em> in their
names, which will require special handling later. These outputs show
you what to do about those spaces in variable names: surround the
variable name with “backticks”. (On my keyboard, that’s on the key
to the left of number 1, where the squiggle is, that looks like a
backwards apostrophe. Probably next to <code>Esc</code>, depending on the
layout of your keyboard.)</p>
<p>Although almost all of the variables are stored as integers, the ones
that have a question mark in their name are actually “logical”, true
or false, with 1 denoting true and 0 false. We could convert them
later if we want to. (A question mark is not a traditional character
to put in a variable name, so we have to surround these variables with
backticks too.)</p>

<li>From your output, verify that you have the
right number of observations and that you have several
variables. Which of your variables correspond to birthweight,
prematureness and length of pregnancy? (You might have to make guesses
based on the names of the variables.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I do indeed have 500 observations on 10 variables (“several”). (If
you don’t have several variables, check to see that you didn’t use
<code>read_delim</code> or something by mistake.) After the
“500 observations of 10 variables” line(s) in each case, you see all the
variables by name, with what type of values they have,

and the first few of the
values.
<label for="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Other possible variable types are <em>num</em> for (real, decimal) numbers such as birth weight, <em>chr</em> for text, and <em>Factor</em> (with the number of levels) for factors/categorical variables. We don’t have any of the last two here. There is also <em>lgl</em> for <em>logical</em>, things that were actually recorded as TRUE or FALSE. We have some variables that are actually logical ones, but they are recorded as integer values.</span></p>
<p>The variable <code>Weight (pounds)</code> is the birthweight (in pounds),
<code>Premie?</code> is 1 for a premature baby and 0 for a full-term baby,
and <code>Weeks Gestation</code> is the number of weeks the pregnancy
lasted. Don’t forget to put backticks around each of those when
you use them
later.

<p>You’ll have seen that I often start with 10 bins, or maybe not quite

<p>which is perfectly acceptable. You can try something a bit more or a
bit less, and see how you like it in comparison. What you are looking
for is a nice clear picture of <em>shape</em>. If you have too few bins,
you’ll lose the shape:</p>

<p>(is that leftmost bin an indication of skewness or some observations

<p>And if you have too many, the shape will be there, but
it will be hard to make out in all the noise, with frequencies going
up and down:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb109"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb109-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb109-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(bw, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> <span class="st">`</span><span class="dt">Weight (pounds)</span><span class="st">`</span>)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins =</span> <span class="dv">30</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I generally am fairly relaxed about the number of bins you use, as
long as it’s not clearly too few or too many. You might have done
exercises in the past that illustrate that the choice of number of
bins (or the class intervals where you move from one bin to the next,
which is another issue that I won’t explore here) can make an
appreciable difference to how a histogram looks.
Extra: I had some thoughts about this issue that I put in a blog
post, that you might like to read:
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/docs/2017/06/08/histograms-and-bins/">link</a>. The
nice thing about Sturges’ rule, mentioned there, is that you can
almost get a number of bins for your histogram in your head (as long
as you know the powers of 2, that is). What you do is to start with
your sample size, here <span class="math inline">\(n=500\)</span>. You find the next power of 2 above
that, which is here <span class="math inline">\(512=2^9\)</span>. You then take that power and add 1,
to get 10 bins. If you don’t like that, you can get R to calculate
it for you:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb110"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb110-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb110-1"></a><span class="kw">nclass.Sturges</span>(bw<span class="op">$</span><span class="st">`</span><span class="dt">Weight (pounds)</span><span class="st">`</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 10</code></pre>
<p>The place where Sturges’ rule comes from is an assumption of normal
data (actually a binomial approximation to the normal, backwards
though that sounds). If you have less than 30 observations, you’ll get
fewer than 6 bins, which won’t do much of a job of showing the
shape. Rob Hyndman wrote a
 about
Sturges’ rule in which he asserts that it is just plain wrong (if you
have taken B57, this note is very readable).</p>
<p>So what to use instead? Well, judgment is still better than something
automatic, but if you want a place to start from, something with a
better foundation than Sturges is the Freedman-Diaconis rule. This, in
its original formulation, gives a bin width rather than a number of bins:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
w=2(IQR)n^{-1/3}
\]</span></p>
<p>The nice thing about this is that it uses the interquartile range, so
it won’t be distorted by outliers. <code>geom_histogram</code> can take a
bin width, so we can use it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>## [1] 26</code></pre>
<p>which turns the Freedman-Diaconis rule into a number of bins rather
than a binwidth; using that gives the same histogram as we got with <code>binwidth</code>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Freedman-Diaconis tends to give too many bins (here
there are 26 rather than the 10 of Sturges). But I put it out there
for you to make your own call.</p>
<p>Another way to go is a “density plot”. This is a smoothed-out version of a histogram that is not obviously frequencies in bins, but which does have a theoretical basis. It goes something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb117"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb117-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb117-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(bw, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> <span class="st">`</span><span class="dt">Weight (pounds)</span><span class="st">`</span>)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_density</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-225-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p><code>geom_density</code> has an optional parameter that controls how smooth
or wiggly the picture is, but the default is usually good.</p>
<p>Alright, before we got distracted, we were assessing normality. What
about that?</p>
<p>It is mostly normal-looking, but I am suspicious about those
<em>very</em> low birth weights, the ones below about 4 pounds. There
are a few too many of those, as I see it.</p>
<p>If you think this is approximately normal, you need to make some
comment along the lines of “the shape is approximately symmetric with no outliers”.
I think my first answer is better, but this answer is
worth something, since it is a not completely unreasonable
interpretation of the histogram.</p>
<p>I have been making the distinction between a histogram (for one
quantitative variable) and side-by-side boxplots (for one quantitative
variable divided into groups by one categorical variable). When you
learned the boxplot, you probably learned it in the context of one
quantitative variable. You can draw a boxplot for that, too, but the
<code>ggplot</code> boxplot has an <code>x</code> as well as a
<code>y</code>. What you do to make a single boxplot is to set the
<code>x</code> equal 1, which produces a weird <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis (that you ignore):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb118"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb118-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb118-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(bw, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">`</span><span class="dt">Weight (pounds)</span><span class="st">`</span>)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-226-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The high weight is actually an outlier, but look at all those outliers
at the bottom!
<label for="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-11" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">When Tukey, a name we will see again, invented the boxplot in the 1950s, 500 observations would have been considered a big data set. He designed the boxplot to produce a sensible number of outliers for the typical size of data set of his day, but a boxplot of a large data set tends to have a lot of outliers that are probably not really outliers at all.</span></p>
<p><em>I</em> think the reason for those extra very low values is that they
are the premature births (that can result in <em>very</em> small
babies). Which leads to the additional question coming up later.</p>

<p>The same warning again, for the same reason.</p>
<p>Notice how the graphs are similar in syntax, because the
what-to-plot is the same (apart from the <code>factor</code> thing) and we
just make a small change in
how-to-plot-it. In the boxplot, the thing on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-scale needs to be
categorical, and <code>Premie?</code> is actually a number, so we’d better
make it into a <code>factor</code>, which is R’s version of a categorical
variable.
<code>Premie.</code> is actually a categorical variable (“premature” or
“not premature”)
masquerading as a quantitative one (1 or 0). It is an “indicator variable”, if
you’re familiar with that term.</p>
<p>It looks as if the breakpoint is 37 weeks: a pregnancy at least that
long is considered normal, but a shorter one ends with a premature
birth. Both plots show the same thing: the `<code>Premie?</code>=1` births
all go with short pregnancies, shorter than 37 weeks. This is
completely clear cut.</p>
<p>Another way to attack this is to use <code>summarize</code>, finding the
max and min:</p>

<p><code>group_by</code> with a number works, even though using the number
in <code>Premie?</code> in a boxplot didn’t. <code>group_by</code> just uses
the distinct values, whether they are numbers, text or factor levels.</p>
<p>Any of these graphs or summaries will help you answer the question, in
the same way. The ultimate issue here is “something that will get the job done”: it doesn’t matter so much what.</p>
<p>In R, <code>NA</code> means “missing”. When you try to compute something
containing a missing value, the answer is usually missing (since you
don’t know what the missing value is). That’s why the first
<code>summarize</code> gave us missing values: there was one missing weeks
of gestation in with all the ones for which we had values, so the max
and min had to be missing as well. In the second <code>summarize</code>,
the one by whether a baby was born prematurely or not, we learn a bit
more about that missing <code>Premie?</code>: evidently its weeks of
gestation was missing as well, since the min and max of that were
missing.

<p>Better.</p>
<p>With the normal-length pregnancies (red), there seems to be no
relationship between length of pregnancy and birth weight, just a
random variation. But with the premature births, a shorter pregnancy
typically goes with a <em>lower</em> birth weight. This would be why the
birth weights for the premature births were more variable.</p>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Do a web search to find the standard (North American)
definition of a premature birth. Does that correspond to what you saw
in the data? Cite the website you used, for example by saying
“according to <code>URL</code>, ldots”, with <code>URL</code> replaced by
the address of the website you found.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The website <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-birth/basics/definition/con-20020050">http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-birth/basics/definition/con-20020050</a>
says that “a premature birth is one that occurs before the start of the 37th week of pregnancy”,
which is exactly what we found. (Note
that I am citing the webpage on which I found this, and I even made it
into a link so that you can check it.) The Mayo Clinic is a famous
hospital system with locations in several US states, so I think we can
trust what its website says.</p>

<div id="nenana-alaska-1" class="section level2" number="4.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.10</span> Nenana, Alaska</h2>
<p>Nenana, Alaska, is about 50 miles west of Fairbanks.
Every spring, there is a contest in Nenana. A wooden tripod is
placed on the frozen river, and people try to guess the exact minute
when the ice melts enough for the tripod to fall through the ice. The
contest started in 1917 as an amusement for railway workers, and has
taken place every year since. Now, hundreds of thousands of people
enter their guesses on the Internet and the prize for the winner can
be as much as $300,000.</p>
<p>Because so much money is at stake, and because the exact same tripod
is placed at the exact same spot on the ice every year, the data are
consistent and accurate. The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/nenana.txt">link</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Read the data into R. Note that the values are
separated by <em>tabs</em> rather than spaces, so you’ll need an
appropriate <code>read_</code> to read it in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>These are “tab-separated values”, so <code>read_tsv</code> is the
thing, as for the Australian athletes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb133"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb133-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb133-1"></a>myurl &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/nenana.txt&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb133-2"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb133-2"></a>nenana &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">read_tsv</span>(myurl)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## cols(
##   Year = col_double(),
##   JulianDate = col_double(),
##   `Date&amp;Time` = col_character()
## )</code></pre>
<p>Use whatever name you like for the data frame. One that is different
from any of the column headers is smart; then it is clear whether you
mean the whole data frame or one of its columns. <code>ice</code> or
<code>melt</code> or anything like that would also be good.</p>
<p>I haven’t asked you to display or check the data (that’s coming up),
but if you look at it and find that it didn’t work, you’ll know to
come back and try this part again. R usually gets it right or gives
you an error.</p>
<p>If you look at the data, they do appear to be separated by spaces, but
the text version of the date and time <em>also</em> have spaces in them,
so things might go astray if you try and read the values in without
recognizing that the actual separator is a tab:</p>

<p>The first line of the data file (with the variable names in it) had no
spaces, only tabs, so <code>read_delim</code> thinks there is <em>one</em>
column with a very long name, but in the actual data, there are
<em>five</em> space-separated columns. The text date-times are of the
form “April 30 at 11:30 AM”, which, if you think it’s all separated
by spaces, is actually 5 things: April, 30, at and so on. These are
the only things that are separated by spaces, so, from that point of
view, there are five columns.</p>

<p>There are 87 years, and 3 columns (variables).
The first column is year, and the last
column is the date and time that the tripod fell into the river,
written as a piece of text. I explain the second column in a moment.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Dates and times are awkward to handle with software. (We
see more ways later in the course.) The column <code>JulianDate</code>
expresses the time that the tripod fell through the ice as a
fractional number of days since December 31. This enables the time
(as a fraction of the way through the day) to be recorded as well,
the whole thing being an ordinary number.
Make a histogram of the Julian dates. Comment briefly on its shape.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>With a <code>ggplot</code> histogram, we need a number of bins
first. I can do Sturges’ rule in my head: the next power of 2 up
from 87 (our <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) is 128, which is <span class="math inline">\(2^7\)</span>, so the base 2 log of
87 rounds up to 7. That plus one is 8, so we need 8 bins. For
you, any not-insane number of bins will do, or any not-insane
bin width, if you want to go that way:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb143"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb143-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb143-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(nenana, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> JulianDate)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins =</span> <span class="dv">8</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-242-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Note that you need to type <code>JulianDate</code> exactly as it
appears, capital letters and all. R is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>This histogram looks more or less symmetric (and, indeed, normal). I
really don’t think you can justify an answer other than “symmetric”
here. (Or “approximately normal”: that’s good too.) If your
histogram is different, say so. I think that “hole” in the middle is
not especially important.</p>
<p>We haven’t done normal quantile plots yet, but looking ahead:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb144"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb144-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb144-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(nenana, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> JulianDate)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-243-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>That hugs the line pretty well, so I would call it close to
normally-distributed. It bulges away from the line because there are
more values just below 120 than you would expect for a
normal. This corresponds to the histogram bar centred just below 120
being taller than you would have expected.
<label for="tufte-mn-14" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-14" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">That is to say, the principal deviation from normality is not the hole on the histogram, the bar centred around 123 being too short, but that the bar centred just below 120 is too <em>tall</em>.</span></p>
<p>Extra: looking <em>way</em> ahead (to almost the end of the R stuff),
this is how you handle the dates and times:</p>

<p>I am not doing any further analysis with these, so just displaying them is good.</p>
<p>I have to do a preliminary step to get the date-times <em>with</em> their year in one place. <code>str_c</code> glues pieces of text together: in this case, the year, a space, and then the rest of the
<code>Date&amp;Time</code>. I stored this in <code>longdt</code>. The second <code>mutate</code> is the business end of it: <code>ymd_hm</code> takes a piece of text containing a year, month (by name or number), day, hours, minutes <em>in that order</em>, and extracts those things from it, storing the whole thing as an R date-time. Note that the AM/PM was handled properly.
The benefit of doing that is we can extract anything from the dates, such as the month or day of week, or take differences between the dates. Or even check that the Julian dates were calculated correctly (the <code>lubridate</code> function is called <code>yday</code> for “day of year”):</p>

<p>Hmm, some of those are off by one. What do the off-by-one ones have in common? Let’s look at more of them. <code>round</code>
rounds off to the nearest integer (since these are actually decimal numbers):</p>

<p>The ones shown here are all <em>after noon</em>, and the Julian date in
the data file appears as one more than the one calculated by
<code>lubridate</code>. What has actually happened is a quirk of how tibbles
are displayed: they show 3 significant digits, <em>rounded</em>. The
Julian dates given by <code>yday</code> are the whole-number part, so the
ones in the data value are that plus more than 0.5, which will round
<em>up</em>. The first line of code below displays 6 significant digits
rather than only three:</p>

<p>Displaying more decimals shows that I was right: <code>jd</code> is (to this accuracy) a whole number, but <code>JulianDate</code> is a decimal with fractional part greater than 0.50.</p>

<p>This is actually a small-but-real downward trend, especially since
about 1960,
but the large amount
of variability makes it hard to see, so I’m good with either “no trend”
or “weak downward trend”
or anything roughly like that. There is definitely not much trend
before 1960, but most of the really early break-ups (less than about
118) have been since about 1990.</p>
<p>You can even add to the <code>ggplot</code>, by putting a smooth trend on it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb151"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb151-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb151-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(nenana, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> Year, <span class="dt">y =</span> JulianDate)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-250-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This is R’s version of a trend that is not constrained
to be linear (so that it “lets the data speak for itself”).</p>
<p>Now there is something obvious to see: after about 1960, there is a clear
downward trend: the ice is breaking up earlier on average every
year. Even though there is a lot of variability, the overall trend,
viewed this way, is clear.</p>
<p>What does this mean, in practice? This notion of the ice melting
earlier than it used to is consistent all over the Arctic, and is one
more indication of climate change. Precisely, it is an indication that
climate change is happening, but we would have to delve further to
make any statements about the <em>cause</em> of that climate change.</p>

<p>I want you to use R to do the counting (that is, don’t just go through

you.</p>
<p>15 females and 20 males, <em>which you should say</em>. I made a point
of <em>not</em> saying that it is enough to get the output with the

<li>Do the CAS scores tend to be higher for females or for males? Draw a suitable graph to help you decide, and come to a conclusion.</li>

<p>Gender is categorical and CAS score is quantitative, so a boxplot would appear to be the thing:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-254-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The median for males is slightly higher, so male accountants are more anxious around computers than female accountants are.</p>
<p>If you wish, side-by-side (or, better, above-and-below) histograms
would also work:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb159"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb159-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb159-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(anxiety,<span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span>CAS))<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins=</span><span class="dv">6</span>)<span class="op">+</span></span>

<p>If you go this way, you have to make a call about where the centres of the histograms are. I guess the male one is slightly further to the right, but it’s not so easy to tell. (Make a call.)</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>Without naming them explicitly means using some other way to pick them out of the data frame, <code>summarize</code> with <code>across</code>.</p>
<p>The basic <code>across</code> comes from asking yourself what the <em>names</em> of those columns have in common: they start with C and the gender column doesn’t:</p>

<p>Read the first one as “across all the columnns whose names start with S, find the mean and SD of them.” The second one is a little clunkier: “acrosss all the columns for which <code>is.numeric</code> is true, find the mean and SD of them”. A shorter way for the second one is “across all the numeric (quantitative) columns, find their mean and SD”, but then you have to remember exactly how to code that. The reason for the <code>list</code> is that we are calculating two statistics for each column that we find. I am using a “named list” so that the mean gets labelled with an <code>m</code> on the end of the column name, and the SD gets an <code>s</code> on the end.</p>
<p>Either of these is good, or anything equivalent (like noting that the two anxiety scales both <code>ends\_with</code> S):</p>

<p>Because I didn’t say otherwise, you should tell me what the means and SDs are, rounding off suitably: the CAS scores have mean 2.82 and SD 0.48, and the CARS scores have mean 2.77 and SD 0.67.</p>

you can do by number so as not to name them), and then find the mean

<p>The male means are slightly higher on both tests, but the male
standard deviations are a little smaller.
You might be wondering whether the test scores are related. They are both quantitative, so the obvious way to find out is a scatterplot:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb169"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb169-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb169-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(anxiety,<span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span>CAS,<span class="dt">y=</span>CARS))<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-264-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The two variables can be on either axis, since there is no obvious
response or explanatory variable. A higher score on one scale goes
with a higher score on the other, suggesting that the two scales are
measuring the same thing.</p>
<p>This plot mixes up the males and females, so you might like to distinguish them, which goes like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb170"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb170-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb170-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(anxiety,<span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span>CAS,<span class="dt">y=</span>CARS,<span class="dt">colour=</span>gender))<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-265-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>There is a slight (but only slight) tendency for the males to be up
and to the right, and for the females to be down and to the left. This
is about what you would expect, given that the male means are slightly
bigger on both scores, but the difference in means is not that big
compared to the SD.</p>

<p>The median for Thomas’s class appears to be quite a bit higher
than for Ken’s class (the difference is actually about 6
marks). It’s up to you whether you think this is a big
difference or not: I want you to have <em>an</em> opinion, but I
don’t mind so much what that opinion is.
Having said that the medians are quite a bit different, note
that the boxes overlap substantially, so that the
<em>distributions</em> of scores are pretty similar (or, the
quartiles of scores are similar, or, the IQR of scores is
similar for the two groups). If you say that, it’s good, but I’m
not insisting that you do.</p>

<p><code>summarize</code> is the <code>tidyverse</code> “verb” that does what
you want here. (The same idea gets the mean score for each class, below.)</p>
<p>The other ways use the basic function <code>median</code>. To make that
work, you need to say that the variable <code>score</code> whose median
you want lives in the data frame <code>marks</code>. These are two ways to
do that.</p>

<p>You can calculate as many summaries as you like. These ones should
match up with the top and bottom of the boxes on the boxplots. The
only restriction is that the things on the right side of the equals
should return a <em>single</em> number. If you have a function like
<code>quantile</code> without anything extra that returns more than one number:</p>

<p>This is kind of a funky <code>group_by</code>. The things in the
<code>data</code> column are the <em>whole</em> rest of the data frame:
there were 5 students in Ken’s class and 6 in Thomas’s, and they each
had a <code>score</code>, so 5 or 6 rows and 1 column. The column
<code>data</code> is known in the trade as a “list-column”.</p>
<p>Now, for each of those mini-data-frames, we want to calculate the
quantiles of <code>score</code>. This is <code>rowwise</code>:
for each of our
mini-data-frames <code>data</code>, calculate the five-number summary of the column called <code>score</code> in <em>it</em>:</p>

<p>I have to be a little bit careful about which data frame I want the

<p>The <code>unnest</code> turns the list-column back into actual data, so we
get the five quantiles for each class.</p>
<p>The only thing this doesn’t do is to show us which quantile is which
(we know, of course, that the first one is the minimum, the last one
is the max and the quartiles and median are in between). It would be
nice to see which is which, though. A trick to do that is to use
<code>enframe</code>, thus:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb195"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb195-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb195-1"></a><span class="kw">quantile</span>(marks<span class="op">$</span>score) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">enframe</span>()</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I don’t normally like the second way with all the brackets, but we’ll
be using it later.</p>
<p>The idea here is that the output from a quantile is a vector, but one
with “names”, namely the percentiles themselves. <code>enframe</code>
makes a two-column data frame with the names and the values. (You can
change the names of the columns it creates, but here we’ll keep track
of which is which.)</p>
<p>So we have a <em>two</em>-column data frame with a column saying
which quantile is which. So let’s rewrite our code to use this:</p>

<p>This deliberately untidies the final answer to make it nicer to look

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.13</span> Unprecendented rainfall</h2>
<p>In 1997, a company in Davis, California, had problems with
odour in its wastewater facility. According to a company official, the
problems were caused by “unprecedented weather conditions” and “because
rainfall was at 170 to 180 percent of its normal level, the water in
the holding ponds took longer to exit for irrigation, giving it more
time to develop an odour.”</p>
<p>Annual rainfall data for the Davis area is <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/rainfall.txt">here</a>.
Note that clicking on the link will display the file, and <em>right</em>-clicking on the link will give you some options, one of which is Copy Link Address, which you can then paste into your R Notebook.</p>
<p>The rainfall is
measured in inches.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<p>Solution</p>
<p>Look at the data file, and see that the values are separated by a

Capital Letters. You can call the data frame whatever you like, but I
think something descriptive is better than eg. .</p>
<p>Extra: this works because there is exactly one space between the year and the
rainfall amount. But the year is always four digits, so the columns
line up, and there is a space all the way down between the year and
the rainfall. That means that this will also work:</p>

<p>This looks as if it worked, but it didn’t, because there is only
 column, of years and rainfalls smooshed together as text,
and if you try to do anything else with them later it won’t work.</p>
<p>Hence those values that might have been tabs actually were
not. There’s no way to be sure about this; you have to try something
and see what works. An indication, though: if you have more than one
space, and the things in the later columns are -justified,
that could be tab-separated; if the things in the later columns are
-justified, so that they finish in the same place but
don’t start in the same place, that is probably aligned columns.</p>

<p>The summary of the years may not be very helpful, but the summary of the annual rainfall values might be. It’s not clear yet why I asked you to do this, but it will become clearer later.</p>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Make a suitable plot of the rainfall values. (We are not,
for the time being, concerned about the years.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is one quantitative variable, so a histogram is your first
thought. This means picking a number of bins. Not too many, since
you want a picture of the shape:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb211"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb211-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb211-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(rain, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span>Rainfall)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins=</span><span class="dv">8</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-287-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>If you picked fewer bins, you’ll get a different picture:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb212"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb212-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb212-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(rain, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span>Rainfall)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins=</span><span class="dv">6</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-288-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The choice of the number of bins depends on what you think the story
about shape is that you want to tell (see next part). You will
probably need to try some different numbers of bins to see which one
you like best. You can say something about what you tried, for example “I also tried 8 bins, but I like the histogram with 6 bins better.”</p>

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>How would you describe the shape of the distribution of

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This will depend on the histogram you drew in the previous
part. If it looks like the first one, the best answer is
“bimodal”: that is, it has two peaks with a gap between them. If
it looks like the second one, you have an easier time; this is
ordinary right-skewness.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>First we
need the 1997 rainfall. Go back and find it in the data. I am borrowing an idea from later in the course (because I am lazy):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb213"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb213-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb213-1"></a>rain <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(Year<span class="op">==</span><span class="dv">1997</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

  </script>
</div>
<p>29.7 inches.</p>
<p>Now, what would be a “normal level” of rainfall? Some kind of average, like a mean or a median, maybe. But we have those, from our summary that we made earlier, repeated here for (my) convenience:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb214"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb214-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb214-1"></a><span class="kw">summary</span>(rain)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##       Year         Rainfall    
##  Min.   :1951   Min.   : 6.14  
##  1st Qu.:1962   1st Qu.:12.30  
##  Median :1974   Median :16.72  
##  Mean   :1974   Mean   :18.69  
##  3rd Qu.:1986   3rd Qu.:25.21  
##  Max.   :1997   Max.   :37.42</code></pre>
<p>The mean is 18.69 and the median is 16.72 inches.</p>
<p>So divide the 1997 rainfall by each of the summaries, and see what happens, using
your calculator, or using R as a calculator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb216"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb216-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb216-1"></a><span class="fl">29.7</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="fl">18.69</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>The 1997 rainfall was about 178 percent of the normal level if the normal

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Do you think the official’s calculation was reasonable?
Explain briefly. (Note that this is not the same as asking whether
the official’s calculation was . This is an important
distinction for you to make.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>There are several approaches to take. Argue for yours.</p>
<p>If you came to the conclusion that the distribution was
right-skewed, you can say that the sensible “normal level” is
the median, and therefore the official did the right thing. Using
the mean would have been the wrong thing.</p>
<p>If you thought the distribution was bimodal, you can go a couple
of ways: (i) it makes no sense to use any measure of location for
“normal” (in fact, the mean rainfall is almost in that low-frequency bar,
and so is not really a “normal level” at all). Or, (ii) it looks
as if the years split into two kinds: low-rainfall years with
around 15 inches, and high-rainfall years with more than 25
inches. Evidently 1997 was a high-rainfall year, but 29.7 inches
was not especially high for a high-rainfall year, so the
official’s statement was an exaggeration. (I think (ii) is more
insightful than (i), so ought to get more points.)</p>
<p>You could even also take a more conspiratorial approach and say
that the official was trying to make 1997 look like a freak year,
and picked the measure of location that made 1997 look more
unusual.</p>
<p>“Normal level” here has nothing to do with a normal
; for this to make sense, the official would
have needed to say something like “normal shape”. This is why
language skills are also important for a statistician to have.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Do you think that the official was right to use the word
“unprecedented” to describe the 1997 rainfall? Justify your answer
briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>“Unprecedented” means “never seen before” or “never having
happened or existed in the past”. <label for="tufte-mn-17" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-17" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Searching for define followed by a word is a good way to find out exactly what that word means, if you are not sure, but you should at least say where you got the definition from if you had to look it up.</span>
That came out of my head; <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/unprecedented">this link</a> has a very similar “never before known or experienced”).</p>
<p>If you look back at your histogram, there are several years that
had over about 30 inches of rain: five or six, depending on your
histogram. One of them was 1997, but there were others too, so
1997 was in no way “unprecedented”.</p>
<p>Another approach that you have seen is to <code>View</code> your dataframe:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb220"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb220-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb220-1"></a><span class="kw">View</span>(rain)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That will come out as a separate tab in your R Studio and you can look at it (yourself; it won’t appear in the Preview). You can look at the 1997 rainfall (29.69 inches) and count how many were bigger than that, 4 of them. Or, save yourself some effort <code>r tufte::margin_note("When you have a computer at your disposal, it's worth taking a few minutes to figure out how to use it to make your life easier.")</code> and sort the rainfall values in descending order (with the biggest one first), by clicking on the little arrows next to Rainfall (twice). Mine looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_2020-09-11_15-17-51.png" style="height:50.0%" /></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.14</span> Learning algebra</h2>
<p>At a high school in New Jersey, teachers were interested in what might help students to learn algebra. One idea was laptops as a learning aid, to see whether having access to one helped with algebra scores. (This was some time ago.) The 20 students in one class were given laptops to use in school and at home, while the 27 students in another class were not given laptops. For all of these students, the final exam score in algebra was recorded. The data are in , with two columns, one indicating whether the student received a laptop or not, and the other giving their score on the algebra final exam.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Read in and display (some of) the data. Do you have (i) the correct number of observations, and (ii) the correct <em>type</em> of columns? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Take a look at the data file first: the data values are <em>aligned in columns</em> with variable numbers of spaces between, so <code>read_table</code> is the thing. Read directly from the URL, rather than trying to copy the data from the website:</p>

<p>There were <span class="math inline">\(20+27=47\)</span> students altogether in the two classes, and we do indeed have 47 rows, one per student. So we have the right number of rows. This is two independent samples; each student was in only one of the two classes, either the class whose students got laptops or not.
The values in the <code>laptop</code> column are text (see the <code>chr</code> at the top), and the values in the <code>score</code> column are numbers (<code>dbl</code> at the top). Alternatively, you can look at the R Console output in which you see that <code>laptop</code> is <code>col_character()</code> (text) and <code>score</code> is <code>col_double()</code> (numerical, strictly a decimal number).</p>
<p>Extra 1: as in the first question, <code>read.table</code> works but it is <em>wrong</em> in this course.</p>
<p>Extra 2: with more than one space between the values, <code>read_delim</code> will not work. Or, perhaps more confusing, it will appear to work and then fail later, which means that you need to pay attention:</p>

<p>This <em>looks</em> all right, but look carefully: the <code>laptop</code> column is correctly text, but the <code>score</code> column, which should be numbers (<code>dbl</code>), is actually text as well. An easier way to see this is to look at the output from the console, which is the descriptions of the columns: they are <em>both</em> <code>col_character</code> or text, while <code>score</code> should be numbers. You might be able to see exactly what went wrong: with more than one space separating the values, the remaining spaces went into <code>score</code>, which then becomes a piece of text with some spaces at the front and then numbers.</p>
<p>This will actually work for a while, as you go through the question, but will come back to bite you the moment you need <code>score</code> to be numerical (eg. when you try to draw a boxplot), because it is actually not numerical at all.</p>
<p>Extra 3: this is the standard R way to lay out this kind of data, with all the outcome values in one column and a second (categorical) column saying which group each observation was in. In other places you might see two separate columns of scores, one for the students with laptops and one for the students without, as below (you won’t understand the code below now, but you will by the end of the course):</p>

<p>A column of <code>yes</code> and a column of <code>no</code>. The classes were of different sizes, so the <code>yes</code> column, with only 20 observations, has some <code>NA</code> (“missing”) observations at the end (scroll down to see them) to enable the dataframe to keep a rectangular shape.</p>
<p>We will learn later what to call these layouts of data: “longer” and “wider” (respectively), and how to convert between them. R usually likes “longer” data, as in the data file, but you will often see data sets displayed wider because it takes up less space.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>The teachers were hoping to see how the laptop-yes and the laptop-no groups compared in terms of algebra scores, so side-by-side boxplots would be helpful. More simply, we have one quantitative and one categorical variable, which is a boxplot according to the table in the notes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb230"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb230-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb230-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(algebra, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> laptop, <span class="dt">y =</span> score)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-298-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Extra: as you will note below, the median score for the students with laptops is a little higher for the students who had laptops. This is easy to see on a boxplot because that is what a boxplot does. (That was what Tukey, who we will meet later, <em>designed</em> the boxplot to do.)</p>
<p>Another plot you might have drawn is a histogram for each group, side by side, or, as they come out here, above and below. This works using facets:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb231"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb231-1"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb231-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(algebra, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> score)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb231-2"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb231-2"></a><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins =</span> <span class="dv">10</span>) <span class="op">+</span></span>
<span id="cb231-3"><a href="data-exploration.html#cb231-3"></a><span class="kw">facet_wrap</span>(<span class="op">~</span>laptop, <span class="dt">ncol =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-299-1.png" width="672"  />
Looking at those, can you <em>really</em> say that the median is slightly higher for the <code>yes</code> group? I really don’t think you can. Certainly it is clear from the histograms that the spread for the <code>yes</code> group is less, but comparing the medians is much more easily done from the boxplot. The teachers were interested in whether the laptops were associated with higher scores on average, so the kind of comparison that the boxplot affords is clearly preferred here.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the code: you imagine you’re going to make a histogram of scores regardless of group, and then at the end you facet by your grouping variable. I added the <code>ncol = 1</code> to make the plots come out in one column (that is, one above the other). If you don’t do this, they come out left and right, which makes the distributions even harder to compare.</p>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Comment briefly on your graph, thinking about what the teachers would like to know.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>There are three things to say something about, the first two of which would probably interest the teachers:</p>
<ul>
<li>comparison of centre: the <em>median</em> score for the group that had laptops is (slightly) higher than for the group that did not.</li>
<li>comparison of spread: the scores for the group that had laptops are less spread out (have smaller <em>interquartile range</em>) than for the group that did not.</li>
<li>assessment of shape: both groups have low outliers, or are skewed to the left in shape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some comments from me:</p>
<ul>
<li>boxplots say <em>nothing</em> about mean and standard deviation, so don’t mention those here. You should say something about the measures of centre (median) and spread (IQR) that they <em>do</em> use.</li>
<li>I think of skewness as a property of a whole distribution, but outlierness as a property of individual observations. So, when you’re looking at this one, think about where the evidence about shape is coming from: is it coming from those one or two low values that are different from the rest (which would be outliers), or is it coming from the whole distribution (would you get the same story if those maybe-outliers are taken away)? My take is that if you take the outliers away, both distributions are close to symmetric, and therefore what you see here is outliers rather than skewness. If you see something different, make the case for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>One reason to suspect skewness or something like it is that test scores have an upper limit (100) that some of the scores got close to, and no effective lower limit (the lower limit is 0 but no-one got very close to that). In this sort of situation, you’d expect the scores to be skewed away from the limit: that is, to the left. Or to have low outliers rather than high ones.</p>

<li>Work out the median and inter-quartile range for the students who did and who did not have laptops, and compare with the boxplot. (In R, the inter-quartile range is <code>IQR</code> in uppercase.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is easy to make way harder than it needs to be: <code>group_by</code> and <code>summarize</code> will do it. Put the two summaries in one <code>summarize</code>:</p>

  </script>
</div>
<p>Then relate these to the information on the boxplot: the centre line of the box is the median. For the <code>no</code> group this is just above 80, so 81 makes sense; for the <code>yes</code> group this is not quite halfway between 80 and 90, so 84 makes sense.</p>
<p>The inter-quartile range is the height of the box for each group. Estimate the top and bottom of the two boxes from the boxplot scale, and subtract. For the <code>no</code> group this is something like <span class="math inline">\(88-68\)</span> which <em>is</em> 20, and for the <code>yes</code> group it is something like <span class="math inline">\(93-80\)</span> which is indeed 13.</p>
<p>Extra: I didn’t ask you here about whether the difference was likely meaningful. The focus here was on getting the graph and summaries. If I had done so, you would then need to consider things like whether a three-point difference in medians could have been chance, and whether we really had random allocation of students to groups.</p>
<p>To take the second point first: these are students who chose to take two different classes, rather than being randomly allocated to classes as would be the case in a true experiment. What we have is really in between an experiment and an observational study; yes, there was a treatment (laptop or not) that was (we hope) randomly allocated to one class and not the other, but the classes could have been different for any number of other reasons that had nothing to do with having laptops or not, such as time of day, teacher, approach to material, previous ability at algebra, etc.</p>
<p>So even if we are willing to believe that the students were as-if randomized to laptop or not, the question remains as to whether that three-point difference in medians is reproducible or indicative of a real difference or not. This is the kind of thing we would try a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test with. In this case, we might doubt whether it will come out significant (because of the small difference in medians and presumably means, compared to the amount of variability present), and, even then, there is the question of whether we <em>should</em> be doing a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test at all, given the outliers.</p>
