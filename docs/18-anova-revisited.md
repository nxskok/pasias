##  Acid rain


 One of the first noticeable effects of climate change was
"acid rain". This is formed by the water vapour in clouds combining
with nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, which come from coal and oil
production. How does the acidity of rain affect the acidity of the
soil on which it falls? (This will have an effect on the kind of
plants that can be grown in that soil.) Acidity is measured using the
pH scale, where a pH of 7 is chemically neutral, a number less than 7
is acidic, and a number greater than 7 is alkaline.

An experiment was conducted at the Florida Institute of Food and
Agricultural Sciences, to determine how acidity of rain affects soil
acidity. Experimental plots were irrigated with rainwater that was
prepared to have one of two different pH levels, 3.7 and 4.5. The
acidity of the soil was then measured at three different depths,
0--15, 15--30, and 30--46 centimetres. This was done on three
different dates, in April and June 1991. The data are in
[link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/acidrain.csv).



(a) Read in and display the data.

Solution


This time, it's a `.csv`:


```r
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/acidrain.csv"
acidrain <- read_csv(my_url)
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   soil_depth = col_character(),
##   date = col_date(format = ""),
##   rain_pH = col_double(),
##   soil_acidity = col_double()
## )
```

```r
acidrain
```

```

There are 4 columns, soil depth, date, pH of the rain that was
applied (all explanatory) and soil acidity, the response. You'll note
that we have one soil acidity value per combination of the other
things (it was a designed experiment).

We're going to ignore the date for now, treating the observations on
different dates as replicates.


(b) Draw a grouped boxplot to show how soil acidity depends on
the pH of the rain and the soil depth. (The first time you do this
you might not get the boxplot you want. How can you fix that?)

Solution


The problem is likely to be that either your `x` or your
`fill` for your boxplot is numerical (`rain_pH` is
`dbl`) rather than the categorical variable you need.
Try to use one of the explanatory variables as `x` and the other
one as `fill` (or `colour`):

```r
ggplot(acidrain, aes(x = rain_pH, y = soil_acidity, fill = soil_depth)) + geom_boxplot()
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1} 

     

That looks as if it worked, but it didn't. See the boxplot below for
how it's supposed to be.  I need `x` for the boxplot needs to
be categorical. The easiest way to make it such is to wrap it in
`factor`:


```r
ggplot(acidrain, aes(x = factor(rain_pH), y = soil_acidity, fill = soil_depth)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-6-1} 

     

Even though `soil_depth` looks like numbers, the printout of
the data frame reveals that it is text, so that is OK.

If you prefer, exchange `x` and `fill`:


```r
ggplot(acidrain, aes(fill = factor(rain_pH), y = soil_acidity, x = soil_depth)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-7-1} 

     


(c) What does your grouped boxplot say about likely
interactions? Explain briefly.

Solution


Think about the effect of one of your explanatory variables, for
each level of the other. For example, in the last plot, the effect
of the rain pH pm on the soil acidity is very small at the largest
and smallest depths, but at the middle soil depth 15--30, the
average (median) soil acidity is a lot less when the rain pH is
*higher* (which seems odd to me). The effect of rain pH being
different according to soil pH is what suggests an interaction
effect. 
Another way of thinking about this is imagining what an
interaction plot would look like. This would be a trace going
through the middle (strictly, mean rather than median) of each set
of boxplots of one colour. In the last boxplot, the red trace
would go close to straight across, while the blue one would dip in
the middle. Not parallel, so suggesting an interaction.
Either approach is good.


(d) Fit an ANOVA with interaction. What do you conclude from
it? You may want to create a column that is the factor version of
`rain_pH` first.

Solution


Following my own hint:

```r
acidrain <- acidrain %>% mutate(frph = factor(rain_pH))
soil.1 <- aov(soil_acidity ~ frph * soil_depth, data = acidrain)
summary(soil.1)
```

```
##                 Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)
## frph             1 0.0304 0.03042   0.759  0.401
## soil_depth       2 0.0671 0.03357   0.838  0.457
## frph:soil_depth  2 0.0078 0.00391   0.097  0.908
## Residuals       12 0.4810 0.04008
```

 

The interaction is nowhere near significant, perhaps surprisingly. But
bear in mind that there are only 18 observations in total, so each box
on the boxplot is based on *three* observations only. So the
interaction would have to be a lot bigger to be significant.

The usual procedure after finding a non-significant
interaction is to take it out:


```r
soil.2 <- update(soil.1, . ~ . - frph:soil_depth)
summary(soil.2)
```

```
##             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)
## frph         1 0.0304 0.03042   0.871  0.366
## soil_depth   2 0.0671 0.03357   0.962  0.406
## Residuals   14 0.4888 0.03492
```

 

The P-values have come down a bit (the result of gaining two df for
error while the error SS only got a tiny bit bigger), but not nearly
enough to be significant.





##  Treating hay fever


 Hay fever is an allergic reaction to things like grasses or
pollen which can make it unpleasant to go outside when the weather is
at its best.  A research lab is developing a new compound to relieve
severe cases of hay fever. There were two active ingredients, labelled
A and B, with each one having three levels, low, medium and
high. There were thus $3\times 3=9$ treatment combinations. 36
subjects were available, and these were randomly assigned to
combinations of levels of factor A and factor B, so that each
combination was tested on 4 people. The response variable was the
number of hours of relief from symptoms (so a higher value is
better). The data are in
[link](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/hayfever.txt).



(a) Read the data and display its structure. Verify that you
have what you were expecting.

Solution


Aligned columns separated by spaces, so `read_table`:

```r
my_url <- "https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/hayfever.txt"
hayfever <- read_table(my_url)
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   relief = col_double(),
##   a = col_character(),
##   b = col_character(),
##   replicate = col_double()
## )
```

```r
hayfever
```

```
## # A tibble: 36 x 4
##    relief a     b      replicate
##     <dbl> <chr> <chr>      <dbl>
##  1    2.4 low   low            1
##  2    2.7 low   low            2
##  3    2.3 low   low            3
##  4    2.5 low   low            4
##  5    4.6 low   medium         1
##  6    4.2 low   medium         2
##  7    4.9 low   medium         3
##  8    4.7 low   medium         4
##  9    4.8 low   high           1
## 10    4.5 low   high           2
## # ... with 26 more rows
```

     

I have 36 observations (patients). There are two categorical columns
`a` and `b` corresponding to the two active ingredients,
and they each seem to have levels low, medium and high.
\marginnote{It's important to be clear about the distinction between a categorical variable, that lives in a data frame column, and its levels, the values that appear in the column. This is especially important if you're trying to decide whether a data frame is tidy, since typically an untidy data frame will have factor levels as column names rather than the factor itself, and you need to be able to tell the difference.}

The `replicate` column labels each observation *within*
its A-B combination, so that each treatment combination was indeed
replicated four times. We won't be using this column in our analysis;
I think it's a refugee from the original untidy format the data was in
before it came to you.


(b) Calculate the mean hours of relief for each combination of
levels of the two active ingredients. Save your results in a data
frame and display that.

Solution


This is a group-by and summarize, but there are two active ingredients and they *both* have to go in the group-by:

```r
d <- hayfever %>% group_by(a, b) %>% summarize(m = mean(relief))
```

```
## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'a' (override with `.groups` argument)
```

```r
d
```

```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
## # Groups:   a [3]
##   a      b          m
##   <chr>  <chr>  <dbl>
## 1 high   high   13.2 
## 2 high   low     5.98
## 3 high   medium 10.3 
## 4 low    high    4.58
## 5 low    low     2.48
## 6 low    medium  4.6 
## 7 medium high    9.12
## 8 medium low     5.45
## 9 medium medium  8.93
```



I'm using my usual name `d` for a temporary data frame. I could
have put brackets around my whole pipeline to display its result, but
I still need to save the data frame `d` to use in a moment.

These levels are in the wrong logical order, but they are in the right order in the original data frame, so we can use `fct_inorder` first, thus:


```r
d2 <- hayfever %>% mutate(a = fct_inorder(a), b = fct_inorder(b)) %>% group_by(a, 
    b) %>% summarize(m = mean(relief))
```

```
## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'a' (override with `.groups` argument)
```

```r
d2
```

```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
## # Groups:   a [3]
##   a      b          m
##   <fct>  <fct>  <dbl>
## 1 low    low     2.48
## 2 low    medium  4.6 
## 3 low    high    4.58
## 4 medium low     5.45
## 5 medium medium  8.93
## 6 medium high    9.12
## 7 high   low     5.98
## 8 high   medium 10.3 
## 9 high   high   13.2
```

 


(c) Make an interaction plot, showing how the mean pain relief depends on the combination of levels of A and B. It is probably easiest to use the data frame you obtained in the previous part.

Solution


My column of mean relief values is called `m`. Use whatever
name you gave it.  I'm going to use my proper-order data frame for
this:

```r
ggplot(d2, aes(x = a, y = m, colour = b, group = b)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-13-1} 

     
Or, you probably had this:

```r
ggplot(d, aes(x = a, y = m, colour = b, group = b)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-14-1} 

     

Since `a` and `b` both have three levels, you could just as well use them the other way around:


```r
ggplot(d2, aes(x = b, y = m, colour = a, group = a)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-1} 

 

The plot looks different depending on how you draw it, but the
conclusion from it (below) will be the same.


(d) What do you conclude from your interaction plot? Explain briefly.

Solution


The three lines are not particularly close to being parallel, so I
would expect to see an interaction between the two active
ingredients (that is, the number of hours of pain relief depends
on the combination of the two of them).

Extra: It is always a judgment call to decide whether the lines
are "approximately parallel" or not. It depends on how much
variability there is in the data, which the interaction plot
doesn't show. Another idea is to add the data to the interaction
plot, colour-coded in the same way. I would do this by taking out
the `geom_point` for the means and add one instead for the
data, taken from the original data frame:

```r
ggplot(d2, aes(x = a, y = m, colour = b, group = b)) + geom_line() + geom_point(data = hayfever, 
    aes(y = relief))
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-16-1} 

     

Technique: for that last `geom_point`, put in anything that
changes: a new data frame, and a new `y` for the plot, but the
`x` and `colour` and `group` are the same as they
were before, so I don't need to specify them.

The points are *very* close to the lines, so there is almost no
residual variability. This makes it more convincing that the
interaction is real and will be significant.


(e) Run an analysis of variance with interaction. What do you conclude?

Solution



```r
hayfever.1 <- aov(relief ~ a * b, data = hayfever)
summary(hayfever.1)
```

```
##             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    
## a            2 220.02  110.01  1827.9 <2e-16 ***
## b            2 123.66   61.83  1027.3 <2e-16 ***
## a:b          4  29.42    7.36   122.2 <2e-16 ***
## Residuals   27   1.63    0.06                   
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

     

The interaction is (strongly) significant. The hours of relief depend on the combination of levels of the active ingredients A and B.

Don't try to interpret the main effects of A and B from here. That's what simple effects are for, coming up.


(f) Analyze the simple effects of B when A is
`medium`. (This means doing an appropriate `aov` and
an appropriate Tukey, if warranted.)

Solution


First, we pull out only the data where A is `medium`, and then we do a one-way analysis of B on that data. This is the slick way, though you can certainly save the result of `filter` first:

```r
simple_medium <- hayfever %>% filter(a == "medium") %>% aov(relief ~ b, data = .)
summary(simple_medium)
```

```
##             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)    
## b            2  34.16  17.081   262.8 1.04e-08 ***
## Residuals    9   0.59   0.065                     
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

     

There is definitely some effect of ingredient B when A is medium. What
is it? Tukey will tell us:


```r
TukeyHSD(simple_medium)
```

```
##   Tukey multiple comparisons of means
##     95% family-wise confidence level
## 
## Fit: aov(formula = relief ~ b, data = .)
## 
## $b
##               diff       lwr       upr     p adj
## low-high    -3.675 -4.178336 -3.171664 0.0000000
## medium-high -0.200 -0.703336  0.303336 0.5323662
## medium-low   3.475  2.971664  3.978336 0.0000000
```

 

There is no difference between medium and high (levels of B), but both of these are better in terms of relief than low is.


(g) Analyze the simple effects of B when A is `high`.

Solution


Same idea: pull out only the data where A is `high`, do a one-way analysis of B, and do Tukey if needed:

```r
simple_high <- hayfever %>% filter(a == "high") %>% aov(relief ~ b, data = .)
summary(simple_high)
```

```
##             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)    
## b            2 107.02   53.51     796 7.49e-11 ***
## Residuals    9   0.61    0.07                     
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

```r
TukeyHSD(simple_high)
```

```
##   Tukey multiple comparisons of means
##     95% family-wise confidence level
## 
## Fit: aov(formula = relief ~ b, data = .)
## 
## $b
##               diff       lwr       upr p adj
## low-high    -7.275 -7.786868 -6.763132 0e+00
## medium-high -2.975 -3.486868 -2.463132 2e-07
## medium-low   4.300  3.788132  4.811868 0e+00
```

     

When A is high, there is definitely an effect of B again, but this
time high (for B) is better than medium is better than low. (All the
P-values in Tukey are very small.)

You could guess this from the interaction plot as well (whichever one
you came up with): when A is high, it is better for B to be high as
well, but when A is medium or low, there is not much difference
between B being medium or high.

Extra: here, the effect of B is different, depending on what A is. This is
what a significant interaction *means*. If there were no
significant interaction, the effect of B would always be the same, no
matter what A was.





##  Focused comparisons of the effect of caffeine


 
Does caffeine help students do better on a certain test? To
find out, 36 students were randomly allocated to three groups (12 in
each group).  Each student received a fixed number of cups of coffee
while they were studying, but the students didn't know whether they
were receiving all full-strength coffee ("high"), all decaf coffee
("low") or a 50-50 mixture of the two ("moderate"). For each
subject, their group was recorded as well as their score on the
test. The data are in
[link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/caffeine.csv), as a
`.csv` file.

This time we look at
contrasts. Suppose I knew ahead of time
that I wanted to compare moderate caffeine with high, and any
caffeine with none. (In the latter case, we're comparing 
"no caffeine" against the average of the other two groups.)

In the previous go-through of the caffeine data, problem 11.5, we
discovered that `amount` was actually text rather than a
factor, but we also discovered that it *didn't matter*. Here it
does matter, so the first thing we have to do is to re-do the
`gather`, creating a factor version of `amount`.



(a) Read in the data again, from
[link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/caffeine.csv), and
display it. This is the untidy format, so name it appropriately:


Solution



```r
my_url <- "http://individual.utoronto.ca/kbutler/stad29/caffeine.csv"
caffeine.untidy <- read_csv(my_url)
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   Sub = col_double(),
##   High = col_double(),
##   Moderate = col_double(),
##   None = col_double()
## )
```

```r
caffeine.untidy
```

```
## # A tibble: 12 x 4
##      Sub  High Moderate  None
##    <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>
##  1     1    72       68    68
##  2     2    65       80    74
##  3     3    68       64    59
##  4     4    83       65    61
##  5     5    79       69    65
##  6     6    92       79    72
##  7     7    69       80    80
##  8     8    74       63    58
##  9     9    78       69    65
## 10    10    83       70    60
## 11    11    88       83    78
## 12    12    71       75    75
```

 

One caffeine level per column, rather than a column of caffeine
levels, so untidy.



(b) Copy your `pivot_longer` from before, only this time add
`names_ptypes = list(amount=factor()` to the end of it. Take a look at the
results. What has changed from before?


Solution


We'll save into `caffeine` again:


```r
caffeine <- caffeine.untidy %>% pivot_longer(-Sub, names_to = "amount", values_to = "score", 
    names_ptypes = list(amount = factor()))
caffeine
```

```
## # A tibble: 36 x 3
##      Sub amount   score
##    <dbl> <fct>    <dbl>
##  1     1 High        72
##  2     1 Moderate    68
##  3     1 None        68
##  4     2 High        65
##  5     2 Moderate    80
##  6     2 None        74
##  7     3 High        68
##  8     3 Moderate    64
##  9     3 None        59
## 10     4 High        83
## # ... with 26 more rows
```

 

The variable created for the "names" is now a
`factor`: it was text before. Maybe we should have made it a
factor before (it wouldn't have done any harm), but we got away with
not doing so.



(c) Using the newly tidied caffeine data, run the ANOVA 
*as a  regression* (that is, using `lm`). Look at the
`summary` of the output. What do you see?


Solution


Extra: I'm going to run the ANOVA the "old way" first, so that we can
compare results. You don't need to do this:

```r
caffeine.old <- aov(score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
summary(caffeine.old)
```

```
##             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)  
## amount       2  477.7  238.86   3.986 0.0281 *
## Residuals   33 1977.5   59.92                 
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

```r
TukeyHSD(caffeine.old)
```

```
##   Tukey multiple comparisons of means
##     95% family-wise confidence level
## 
## Fit: aov(formula = score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
## 
## $amount
##                    diff       lwr       upr     p adj
## Moderate-High -4.750000 -12.50468  3.004679 0.3025693
## None-High     -8.916667 -16.67135 -1.161987 0.0213422
## None-Moderate -4.166667 -11.92135  3.588013 0.3952176
```

       

End of digression.


Now we'll do it using `lm`, with contrasts later, and see how
things change:

```r
caffeine.2 <- lm(score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
summary(caffeine.2)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -11.833  -6.958  -2.458   6.354  15.167 
## 
## Coefficients:
##                Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)      76.833      2.235  34.383  < 2e-16 ***
## amountModerate   -4.750      3.160  -1.503  0.14234    
## amountNone       -8.917      3.160  -2.821  0.00803 ** 
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 7.741 on 33 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.1946,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.1458 
## F-statistic: 3.986 on 2 and 33 DF,  p-value: 0.02815
```

       
Look at the slopes. They are `amount` followed by one of the
amounts of caffeine. R is using "high" as a baseline  (that's the
first level alphabetically), so the
`amountModerate` line is testing high vs.\ moderate: high is
*not* significantly higher, in terms of test scores, than
moderate. That's one of the things I wanted to test. What about the
coefficient for `amountNone`? That's none vs.\ *high*,
since high was the baseline. This is, as we saw from Tukey,
significant. But it is not what I said we wanted to test. 

Extra: in case you're curious, you can also get the regular analysis of
variance table as below. `anova` is multi-talented:


```r
anova(caffeine.2)
```

```
## Analysis of Variance Table
## 
## Response: score
##           Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)  
## amount     2  477.72 238.861  3.9861 0.02815 *
## Residuals 33 1977.50  59.924                  
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

 

The problem is that you can't naturally do Tukey this way, which is
often what you want to do next. That's why we used `aov` before.

Since we have a regression model (albeit a peculiar one), we can test
whether we should remove `amount` (that is, whether it has any
impact on test scores) this way too:


```r
drop1(caffeine.2, test = "F")
```

```
## Single term deletions
## 
## Model:
## score ~ amount
##        Df Sum of Sq    RSS    AIC F value  Pr(>F)  
## <none>              1977.5 150.22                  
## amount  2    477.72 2455.2 154.01  3.9861 0.02815 *
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

 

Same conclusion: there is some effect of caffeine level on test score.



(d) Obtain the different values of `amount`, in the order
that R has them.


Solution


Count them, or find the distinct ones:


```r
caffeine %>% group_by(amount) %>% summarize(count = n())
```

```
## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   amount   count
##   <fct>    <int>
## 1 High        12
## 2 Moderate    12
## 3 None        12
```

 

or there is this shortcut to the above:


```r
caffeine %>% count(amount)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   amount       n
##   <fct>    <int>
## 1 High        12
## 2 Moderate    12
## 3 None        12
```

 

Or


```r
caffeine %>% distinct(amount)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 1
##   amount  
##   <fct>   
## 1 High    
## 2 Moderate
## 3 None
```

 

since we didn't really need to know how many of each there were.

These would all have worked if `amount` had been text rather a
factor. If you have a genuine `factor`, you can also ask for
its `levels`:


```r
with(caffeine, levels(amount))
```

```
## [1] "High"     "Moderate" "None"
```

 

or `summary` will count them up and list them:


```r
caffeine %>% select(amount) %>% summary()
```

```
##       amount  
##  High    :12  
##  Moderate:12  
##  None    :12
```

 

This last won't work if you have a categorical-variable-as-text. It
has to be a genuine factor for it to work.

The categories are High, Moderate and None in that order.  For working
with contrasts, we need to have the thing we're making contrasts for
(see below) as a `factor`, otherwise it won't work.



(e) Create a contrast that compares High with Moderate, ignoring
None. That is, create a vector whose length is the same as the
number of levels of `amount`, and which has a 1 to represent
High and a $-1$ to represent Moderate. 


Solution


Put a 0 in for None:

```r
c.hm <- c(1, -1, 0)
```

       

Having the 1 and the $-1$ the other way around would also have been fine.



(f) Create a contrast that compares "any caffeine" against
"none" by comparing None against the average of Moderate and High.


Solution



```r
c.any <- c(-0.5, -0.5, 1)
```

 
Note that both our contrasts have coefficients that add up to zero, as
they must:


```r
sum(c.hm)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

```r
sum(c.any)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

 



(g) Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.


Solution


Multiply them together and check that what you get adds up to zero:

```r
sum(c.hm * c.any)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

 

Zero, so orthogonal. You can check that writing `c.any` as
`c(-1,-1,2)` would also work (and still be orthogonal with
`c.hm`), and so would writing it as `c(1,1,-2)`. 



(h) Arrange your contrasts as columns of a matrix (using
`cbind`), and say that you want to use these as contrasts for
`amount` (in data frame `caffeine` or whatever you
called it).


Solution



```r
m <- cbind(c.hm, c.any)
contrasts(caffeine$amount) <- m
```

 



(i) Fit the ANOVA as an `lm`, and look at the
`summary`. What do you conclude about your contrasts?


Solution



```r
caff.3 <- lm(score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
summary(caff.3)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -11.833  -6.958  -2.458   6.354  15.167 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)   72.278      1.290  56.022   <2e-16 ***
## amountc.hm     2.375      1.580   1.503   0.1423    
## amountc.any   -4.361      1.825  -2.390   0.0227 *  
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 7.741 on 33 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.1946,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.1458 
## F-statistic: 3.986 on 2 and 33 DF,  p-value: 0.02815
```

 

`c.hm` was the contrast between high and moderate
caffeine. This is not significant (P-value 0.142), which is the same
conclusion as Tukey, but the P-value here is quite a bit lower (and
thus closer to being significant). There's a reason for that: here we
are focusing in on the two contrasts that we really wanted to test,
and ignoring the $F$-test and the Tukey that tell us stuff that we
don't care about. By focusing our comparison, we get a better
(smaller) P-value.

`c.any` was none vs.\ average of any
caffeine. This one is significant, with a P-value of 0.023. So this
contrast tells us that having any caffeine is better than having none.



(j) What happens if you try to use high caffeine vs.\ moderate
caffeine and moderate vs.\ none as your two contrasts?


Solution



```r
c.hm <- c(1, -1, 0)
c.mn <- c(0, 1, -1)
```

 

So far so good: the coefficients add up to zero and they reflect the
right comparisons. But now:


```r
sum(c.hm * c.mn)
```

```
## [1] -1
```

 

This does *not* add up to zero, so these two contrasts are not
orthogonal, and we can't do what we just did. R will give us an answer
if we try it, but it'll be the *wrong* answer.
\marginnote{SAS, for example, has a way of making non-orthogonal contrasts orthogonal in a way that the user doesn't have to worry about, but in R, you are closer to the ground, so to speak, and you have to make it happen yourself.}

The best
description I have seen of what to do here is by David Howell,
\marginnote{Howell is the author of a famous text on Statistics in Psychology.} at
[link](https://www.uvm.edu/~dhowell/StatPages/More_Stuff/R/AnovaOneway.html)
(at the bottom).
Let
me try to follow his method. 

First we need a vector that is all 1's, which I have called
`c0` below. Since each of our contrasts `c.hm` and
`c.mn` have 3 things in them (3 groups), we need to add a
"dummy" 3rd contrast to give us a $3\times 3$ array of numbers:
\marginnote{which we are going to invert, as a matrix. But I get ahead of myself.}


```r
c0 <- rep(1, 3)
m <- cbind(c0, c.hm, c.mn)
m
```

```
##      c0 c.hm c.mn
## [1,]  1    1    0
## [2,]  1   -1    1
## [3,]  1    0   -1
```

 

This is what Howell calls an "augmented" matrix of contrasts, since
it has our two contrasts as the second and third columns, plus
the extra dummy one. Next we invert this matrix of contrasts,
which we can do because it's square. `t(m)` means 
"take the matrix transpose of `m`", if you're trying to keep up at the
back, and `solve` finds a matrix inverse:


```r
minv <- solve(t(m))
```

 

and then we remove the first column, which represents the contrast
that we didn't want anyway (what Howell calls "deaugmenting"):
\marginnote{We are working with R matrices here rather than data frames, so we access elements, rows and columns using the square bracket notation: inside the square brackets, we put first the numbers of the rows we want, then a comma, then the numbers of the columns. There are two special pieces of notation, both of which I use here: leaving the row or column slot blank means all the rows or all the columns, and using a negative row or column number means all the rows or columns except the one(s) named. Thus my notation here is all the rows, and all the columns except for the first one. You can access data frames this way too, but the Tidyverse makes it much easier.}


```r
m.contr <- minv[, -1]
m.contr
```

```
##            c.hm       c.mn
## [1,]  0.6666667  0.3333333
## [2,] -0.3333333  0.3333333
## [3,] -0.3333333 -0.6666667
```

```r
contrasts(caffeine$amount) <- m.contr
```

 

The columns of `m.contr` are our new 
contrasts. Note that they appear to be something else: high vs.\ the
average of moderate and none, and none vs.\ the average of moderate
and high. Note that they are actually
*not* orthogonal, but if Howell is to be trusted, they can be
used to test what we want. I think Howell is famous enough to be
trusted. 
Now fit the model again:


```r
caff.4 <- lm(score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
summary(caff.4)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = score ~ amount, data = caffeine)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -11.833  -6.958  -2.458   6.354  15.167 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)   72.278      1.290  56.022   <2e-16 ***
## amountc.hm     4.750      3.160   1.503    0.142    
## amountc.mn     4.167      3.160   1.318    0.196    
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 7.741 on 33 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.1946,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.1458 
## F-statistic: 3.986 on 2 and 33 DF,  p-value: 0.02815
```

 

The rows `amountc.hm` and `amountc.mn` are the proper tests
for our contrasts `c.hm` and `c.mn`. 
`c.hm` is not significant (P-value 0.14) and
`c.mn` is not significant either
(P-value 0.20). This is the same significance as from Tukey, but note
that the P-values for the non-significant tests are much lower than
the corresponding ones from Tukey, once again because we have focused
on just these comparisons, and not on any others. We decided ahead of
time to test just these, and gave ourselves the best chance of finding
significance that we could.






##  Who studies the most outside class?


 A social scientist wanted to see how many hours students
 studied outside of class. She took a random sample of 75 students
 from three different majors: math, social science and English, and
 recorded the number of weekly outside-class study hours for each
 student. The data can be found at
 [link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/studyhours.txt). The
 social scientist had two research questions: whether math students study
 more outside of class than the other students, and whether English and
 social science students study different amounts of time outside class.


(a) Explain briefly why contrasts would be a better idea here
than ANOVA with Tukey.


Solution


The researcher is not interested in all the comparisons between
the groups, but rather in two specific ones (as detailed in the
question). So we should focus our attention on those
comparisons. This is what contrasts are for.



(b) Read in the data and make side-by-side boxplots of study
hours by major. What do the boxplots suggest about the comparisons
that the researcher wants to make?


Solution


Separated by one space. There appear to be some strange quotes
in there, but we'll ignore those and see whether they cause any
trouble: 

```r
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/studyhours.txt"
studyhours <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   id = col_double(),
##   major = col_character(),
##   hours = col_double()
## )
```

```r
studyhours
```

```
## # A tibble: 75 x 3
##       id major hours
##    <dbl> <chr> <dbl>
##  1     1 math     15
##  2     2 math     20
##  3     3 math     14
##  4     4 math     15
##  5     5 math     14
##  6     6 math     10
##  7     7 math     12
##  8     8 math      9
##  9     9 math     10
## 10    10 math     11
## # ... with 65 more rows
```

        

So far so good. 75 students, in tidy format.


```r
ggplot(studyhours, aes(x = major, y = hours)) + geom_boxplot()
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-45-1} 

 

This suggests that the math students study more than the others, but
the English and social science students study about the same amount.

I see some rather consistent right-skewness here (but no outliers). We
have 25 observations in each group, a decent amount of data, so I'm
not too worried, but a transformation could be a good idea, something
like square root, perhaps. The spreads are not that unequal, but it
*is* true that the Math students have both the largest median
*and* the largest spread, and the social science students are the
lowest on both.

Extra: Box-Cox also works on ANOVA-type data, since that is an `lm`
kind of model:


```r
boxcox(hours ~ major, data = studyhours)
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-46-1} 

 

This suggests that some kind of transformation would be a good idea
(no transformation, power 1, is not supported by the data). My guess
of 0.5 is not bad; that, or something a bit less like 0.25 (fourth
root) would be good. Even log is supportable. But we'll proceed
without transformation in this question to give you some practice with
contrasts. Despite appearances, I do (sometimes) like to make things
not so complicated!



(c) Set up contrasts for each of the researcher's research
questions, bearing in mind the levels of `major` and the
order in which they come. (For the `Math` contrast, you want
Math against the average of the other two.)


Solution


We need to know what the categories of `major` are, so that
we can set up the contrasts correctly, so let's start with that:

```r
studyhours %>% select(major) %>% summary()
```

```
##     major          
##  Length:75         
##  Class :character  
##  Mode  :character
```

 

Oh. Yeah. We never turned `major` into a factor. We'd better do
that, and then try again:


```r
studyhours <- studyhours %>% mutate(major = factor(major))
studyhours %>% select(major) %>% summary()
```

```
##      major   
##  english:25  
##  math   :25  
##  socsci :25
```

 

In alphabetical order.

All right, contrasts. The English vs.\ social science one is easier,
so we'll do that first. Just set it up with a 1 for one of them and a
$-1$ for the other and 0 for math, in the right order according to
what the levels are, viz:


```r
c.eng.socsci <- c(1, 0, -1)
```

 

Or `c(-1,0,1)` would be just as good.

The other one is a bit trickier, because you want math against the
average of the others, like
$$\mbox{math}-(\mbox{English}+\mbox{socsci})/2.$$ 
This translates into contrast-ese like this, making sure to get Math
in the middle where it belongs:
\marginnote{As I failed to do the first time.}


```r
c.math.others <- c(-0.5, 1, -0.5)
```

 

The coefficients have to add up to zero, so I have to have two halves
to balance my one 1. Or I can use two $-1$s and a 2.



(d) Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.


Solution


Multiply them together (elementwise, which is how R does it)
and show that what you get adds up to zero:

```r
sum(c.eng.socsci * c.math.others)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

 

Zero. Orthogonal.

So we are safely in "familiar" territory, not in the 
here-be-dragons
\marginnote{On ancient maps, people didn't know what was  in certain parts of the world, because no-one had ever explored  them, so they wrote on the map *here be dragons*.} land of
non-orthogonal contrasts.



(e) Create a matrix of contrasts (using `cbind`) and let
`lm` know that these are contrasts for `major`, in
data frame `studyhours` (or whatever you called it).


Solution


So, like the example in class (where the
`contrasts(model)` was admittedly rather confusing):

```r
m <- cbind(c.math.others, c.eng.socsci)
m
```

```
##      c.math.others c.eng.socsci
## [1,]          -0.5            1
## [2,]           1.0            0
## [3,]          -0.5           -1
```

```r
contrasts(studyhours$major) <- m
```

        



(f) Fit the model using `lm`. What do you conclude about
your contrasts?


Solution


Pretend the ANOVA is a regression (though you can fit ANOVAs
either way: we just used `aov` before because we were
going to follow up with Tukey):

```r
studyhours.1 <- lm(hours ~ major, data = studyhours)
summary(studyhours.1)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = hours ~ major, data = studyhours)
##

There is a seriously significant difference between the math students
and the others. There is not, however, any kind of difference between
the mean study hours of the English and social science students. 



(g) Are you surprised by the significance or non-significance you
found in the previous part? Explain briefly.


Solution


Go back and compare with the  boxplots. The math students
studied noticeably more than the others, so it is not
surprising that this difference came out significant. The
median study times for the English and social science students
were similar, so it is not at all surprising that this difference
failed to be significant.

When you set up contrasts, *these* are the tests you are
interested in, so there is no reason for following up with
Tukey or anything else. But you have to be able to say ahead of
time which contrasts you want to test. This is in
contrast
\marginnote{In contrast. Get it? No? Well, never mind then.} to Tukey, where you don't have to decide
which comparisons interest you until right at the end.

Another question you might have had is 
"how many contrasts can I do"? To answer this, go back and look at the ANOVA table. If
you run an ANOVA using `lm`, you get the ANOVA table by
passing the fitted model object into `anova` rather than
`summary`:
\marginnote{*anova* is one of R's  multi-purpose tools; what it does depends on what you feed it.}

```r
anova(studyhours.1)
```

```
## Analysis of Variance Table

Two degrees of freedom for `major`, so we can do 2
contrasts. (The example in class had four models of chainsaw, so 3 df
for model, so 3 contrasts possible.) What if we don't use all those
contrasts up? Try it and see:


```r
m <- cbind(c.math.others)
m
```

```
##      c.math.others
## [1,]          -0.5

```r

```



The two P-values are identical, but the second one is not now
identified with any contrast (so we just ignore it). If we were only
interested in how math students compared with the rest, we could test
it this way.

Or, we could relabel the students as "math" and "other" and just
do a two-sample $t$-test. To do this, we need to delve into
`forcats` (which is a part of the `tidyverse`). It deals
with categorical variables which are genuine factors, which we haven't
had much cause to do so far. But now we do. What we want to do is to
*recode* the levels of `major`, which is done by
`fct_recode`:


```r
studyhoursx <- studyhours %>% mutate(mathrest = fct_recode(major, rest = "english", 
    rest = "socsci"))
studyhoursx %>% count(mathrest)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   mathrest     n
##   <fct>    <int>
## 1 rest        50
## 2 math        25
```

 

The way `fct_recode` works is that you first give a factor,
here `major`, then you define a list of new levels in terms of
the old ones. We want a student whose major is either English or
Social Science to end up in the new not-math group that we'll call
`rest`, so we need two lines inside `fct_recode`, one
that says that the new `rest` group includes the old
`english` majors, and another that says that `rest` also
includes the old `socsci` majors. Any levels not mentioned
(here `math`) are left unchanged.

I did this wrong the first time: I got the things before and after the
`=` in `fct_recode` the wrong way around.

The last line is to check that the result makes sense. I previously
had 25 students in each major. Now I have 25 students for whom
`mathrest` is `math` (the math majors) and $50=25+25$
students for whom `mathrest` is `rest` (everyone else). 

Now, the $t$-test.


```r
t.test(hours ~ mathrest, data = studyhoursx, var.equal = T)
```

```
## 
## 	Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  hours by mathrest
## t = -3.7269, df = 73, p-value = 0.0003796
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -4.880528 -1.479472
## sample estimates:
## mean in group rest mean in group math 
##               6.26               9.44
```

 

This is very close to, but not the same as, the test with the contrasts,
because we are not quite testing the same thing. Here, we are
comparing the mean of the math students to the mean of everyone else,
thrown together into one big bag, but with the contrasts, we are
comparing the mean of the math students with the \emph{average of the
means} of the other two groups, treating them as different. (Not
clear? Well, it's not that clear to me either.)

That business with the `var.equal=T`? This is doing a pooled
$t$-test. I did that here because the ANOVA is assuming equal spreads
within the groups (which is what a pooled $t$-test does) and I thought
I should do my best to be consistent. A pooled $t$-test is really a
two-group one-way ANOVA, or at least it is if it is done two-sided.


 



##  Mental context


 It is believed that being in the same mental context for
learning and for testing leads to better test scores. An experiment
was carried out to test this. During the learning phase, subjects
learned a list of 80 words in a room painted orange and decorated with
posters, paintings and other paraphernalia.
\marginnote{This is a fancy  word for *stuff*.} A memory test was given to all subjects
immediately after they had learned the words, to give the impression
that the experiment was over. (The results of this test were
discarded.) One day later, subjects were unexpectedly re-tested under
different experimental conditions and asked to write down all the
words of the original list that they could remember. The re-test took
place in five different conditions, which subjects were randomly
allocated to one of:



* Same context: in the original orange-painted room.

* Different context: in a very different room, painted grey and
located in a different part of campus.

* Imaginary context: in the grey room, but subjects are asked to
remember the orange room in which they took the original test. To
help them with this, the experimenter begins by asking them several
questions about the orange room and the objects in it.

* Photographed context: in the grey room, but subjects are shown
photographs of the orange room.

* Placebo context: in the grey room, with subjects first being
asked to recall their living room.


In each case, the response variable was the number of words on the
original list successfully recalled by each subject.

50 subjects in total completed the experiment, 10 under each of the 5
conditions. 

The researchers had four research hypotheses to test with the data:



* Groups where the context matches (is the same, or is simulated
by imagining or photograph) will perform better than groups with
different or placebo contexts.

* The group with the same context will differ from the group with
imaginary or photographed contexts.


* The imaginary-context group will differ from the
photographed-context group.

* The different-context group will differ from the placebo-context group.


The research hypotheses are (as is usual) written as
*alternative* hypotheses. We can rewrite them as null
hypotheses, with some extra wording to facilitate converting them
into contrasts, like this:


* The mean of the `same`, `imaginary` and
`photograph` groups (group means) is equal to the mean of the
`different` and `placebo` groups (group means).

* The mean of the `imaginary` and `photograph`
groups is equal to the (mean of the) `same` group.

* The `imaginary` and the `photograph` groups will
have the same mean.

* The `different` and the `placebo` groups will
have the same mean.

The data are in
[link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/smith.txt) (the
original researcher's name was Smith). 


(a) Read in the data and verify that you have a column called
`context` that is text and a column called
`words` that is a (whole) number.


Solution


The usual thing --- read in the data appropriately and look at the
data frame you got:

```r
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/smith.txt"
smith <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   id = col_double(),
##   context = col_character(),
##   words = col_double()
## )
```

```r
smith
```

```
## # A tibble: 50 x 3
##       id context words
##    <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>
##  1     1 same       25
##  2     2 same       26
##  3     3 same       17
##  4     4 same       15
##  5     5 same       14
##  6     6 same       17
##  7     7 same       14
##  8     8 same       20
##  9     9 same       11
## 10    10 same       21
## # ... with 40 more rows
```

       

`dbl` actually means "decimal number", but these look like whole numbers, so I think we are good.
      


(b) Turn `context` into a `factor`, within the
data frame. (We are going to be doing contrasts). Display how the
data frame now looks.


Solution


Use `mutate` and assign everything back to what it was
before:

```r
smith <- smith %>% mutate(context = factor(context))
smith
```

```
## # A tibble: 50 x 3
##       id context words
##    <dbl> <fct>   <dbl>
##  1     1 same       25
##  2     2 same       26
##  3     3 same       17
##  4     4 same       15
##  5     5 same       14
##  6     6 same       17
##  7     7 same       14
##  8     8 same       20
##  9     9 same       11
## 10    10 same       21
## # ... with 40 more rows
```

    

Note that `context` is now labelled as the factor that we made.



(c) What are the names of the five contexts in the data set
(just display them),
and what order are they in?


Solution


You have lots of choices now, since `context` is a factor
(and can also be treated as text). 
The most obvious factor-based way is this:

```r
levels(smith$context)
```

```
## [1] "different"  "imaginary"  "photograph" "placebo"    "same"
```

       

or use `summary`:


```r
smith %>% select(context) %>% summary()
```

```
##        context  
##  different :10  
##  imaginary :10  
##  photograph:10  
##  placebo   :10  
##  same      :10
```

 

Or treat `context` as text, such as this way:

```r
smith %>% count(context)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 2
##   context        n
##   <fct>      <int>
## 1 different     10
## 2 imaginary     10
## 3 photograph    10
## 4 placebo       10
## 5 same          10
```

       

These all display the contexts in alphabetical order.

Or display the distinct values:


```r
smith %>% distinct(context)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 1
##   context   
##   <fct>     
## 1 same      
## 2 different 
## 3 imaginary 
## 4 photograph
## 5 placebo
```

 

or, without using the `tidyverse`,


```r
unique(smith$context)
```

```
## [1] same       different  imaginary  photograph placebo   
## Levels: different imaginary photograph placebo same
```

 
These two *don't* display things in alphabetical order, because
they display things as they appear in the file. This is not the order
we want, though the second way *does* display the `Levels`
in the right order.
      


(d) Write each of the four research hypotheses (in the
null-hypothesis versions) as R vectors that can be used to make
contrasts. (This will mean getting the contexts in the right
order. If you get stuck, do the last two first, since they're
easiest. The first one is actually the hardest.)


Solution


All right, let's go from the bottom:


* Different and placebo have same means. These are 1st and 4th.

```r
c4 <- c(1, 0, 0, -1, 0)
```

         

* Imaginary and photograph have same means. 2nd and 3rd:

```r
c3 <- c(0, 1, -1, 0, 0)
```

   


* Imaginary and photograph together same as `same`. This
time we have two means being compared with one, so we need to give
the two means half weight. 2nd and 3rd against 5th:

```r
c2 <- c(0, 1/2, 1/2, 0, -1)
```

   


* (Same and imaginary and photograph) vs.\ (different or placebo):
2nd, 3rd and 5th with weight $1/3$ (three of them) against 1st and
4th with weight $1/2$ (2 of them):

```r
c1 <- c(-1/2, 1/3, 1/3, -1/2, 1/3)
```

   

Variations: you can switch the sign on everything within a
contrast (since it doesn't matter which is plus and which is
minus). You can also multiply through by anything to get rid of
the fractions, for example these:

```r
c2 <- c(0, 1, 1, 0, -2)
c1 <- c(-3, 2, 2, -3, 2)
```

       

All that matters is that the coefficients add up to zero, and that they are the right size and sign relative to each other.
      


(e) Pick two of your contrasts (doesn't matter which two) and
demonstrate that they are orthogonal.


Solution


Multiply your chosen contrasts together elementwise, and show
that the results add to zero, eg. by showing the whole thing:

```r
c1 * c2
```

```
## [1]  0.0000000  0.1666667  0.1666667  0.0000000 -0.3333333
```

    
which adds to zero because it is $2/6$ minus $1/3$,
or by explicitly summing the elementwise product:


```r
sum(c1 * c3)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

 

Any pair is good.
      


(f) Collect your contrasts together into a matrix, and
tell `lm` that these are the contrasts for `context`.


Solution


This:

```r
m <- cbind(c1, c2, c3, c4)
contrasts(smith$context) <- m
```

       

Slipping off into another aside, you might have been wondering whether
there was a way to test 
*all* the contrasts for orthogonality at once. There is, and it
depends on the rules for matrix multiplication. We want to test all
the *columns* of `m` for orthogonality, but matrix
multiplication works by combining a *row* with a column. No
matter, *transposing* a matrix interchanges rows and columns, so
that in math, we want to look at the matrix $M^T M$. In R,
`%*%` means "matrix multiply".
\marginnote{In R, percents around something mean that it is a special version of that something. Hence the notation for matrix-multiply and the pipe symbol. A regular * when used for multiplying matrices in R will multiply them element by element.} Thus,


```r
t(m) %*% m
```

```
##           c1  c2 c3 c4
## c1 0.8333333 0.0  0  0
## c2 0.0000000 1.5  0  0
## c3 0.0000000 0.0  2  0
## c4 0.0000000 0.0  0  2
```

 
This matrix-multiplies the transpose of `m` by `m`
itself. There are numbers down the top-left to bottom-right diagonal,
but don't worry about these, since a contrast doesn't have to be
orthogonal with itself. The thing to note is that 
*all the other  elements* of this matrix are 
*zero*: that means that each of
the four contrasts is orthogonal to each of the other three.
      


(g) Fit a model with `lm`, and display the results.


Solution


We're past the hard part:

```r
smith.1 <- lm(words ~ context, data = smith)
summary(smith.1)
```

```
##

```

       
      


(h) For each of the original research hypotheses, what do you
infer about them?


Solution


Even though I generated the contrasts backwards, I maintained
the numbering so that they refer to the original numbered
hypotheses. You might have named them something more mnemonic;
that works too, and is quite possibly better.
Anyway:


* Matching context better than non-matching context:
strongly significant (P-value 0.000085). (Strictly, this is a
two-sided test, but the way I constructed the contrast, this
should be significantly *positive* if the research
hypothesis is true, and it is.)

* Same context *not* different from
imaginary/photographed context (P-value 0.823)

* Imaginary context *not* different from photographed context (P-value 0.938).

* Different context *not* different from placebo
context (P-value 0.699). 


I wanted you to match up the research hypotheses with the
P-values, as above, and state a conclusion about each one. If
you do that, I am happy.

Taking this back to the original research, I think the
first hypothesis was the most immediately important of the four:
we were able to show that having (or faking up) the original
room helped with recall. After that, it didn't matter how it was
done: being in the original room was not different from
imagining the original room (by thinking about it or seeing a
photo of it). Failing to recall the original room was equally
bad, whether the subjects were in a different room and not asked
to think about the original orange room, or whether they were
literally asked to think about another room entirely.

Contrasts enabled us to tackle this problem and gain a very clear
conclusion: recalling the original orange room is helpful, but
it doesn't matter how you do it.

How big of a difference does thinking about the orange room
make? You can use the 2 SE thing to get a 95\% confidence interval:
the difference in the (mean of the) recall-orange-room means and
the (mean of the) don't-recall means is between about 4.6 and
12.6 words (out of 80). I leave it for you to decide whether
that is practically important as well as being statistically significant.

      





##  Trying on shirts


 Does it make a difference if you see somebody else trying on
a shirt before you do, and if so, does it matter what kind of person
it is? 

An experiment was carried out in a university bookstore, with
students who wanted to try on a shirt serving as (unsuspecting)
experimental subjects. When a student wanted to try on a shirt, the
sales associate told them that there was only one shirt left, and it
was being tried on by an "other customer". This "other customer"
was actually a "confederate" of the experimenter (that means, they
were pretending to be a real customer but were actually part of the
experiment). The "other customer" was always female: either an
attractive well-dressed model, or an average-looking student wearing
jeans. The "other customer" would come out of the
dressing room and hand the shirt to the sales associate, who would
give it to the student who wanted to try it on. When the student had
tried on the shirt, they were asked to rate it on a 7-point scale (on
five different dimensions, and those five scores were then
averaged). Does a student's evaluation depend on whether the student
was male or female, and whether the "other customer" was a model or
a student? There was also a control group, where the student was
handed the shirt directly  by the sales associate, without the 
"other customer" being involved at all. 

There were thus five treatments:
male students who saw a model, male students who saw a student, female
students who saw a model, female students who saw a student, and the
control group. There were 25 students in each treatment group.

The data from this experiment can be found at
[link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/shirts.csv).



(a) Read in and display the data. How many observations do you
have, and is that what you should have?

Solution


`read_csv`:

```r
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/shirts.csv"
shirts <- read_csv(my_url)
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   treatment = col_character(),
##   score = col_double()
## )
```

```r
shirts
```

```
## # A tibble: 125 x 2
##    treatment         score
##    <chr>             <dbl>
##  1 male_seeing_model   6.8
##  2 male_seeing_model   4.7
##  3 male_seeing_model   5.1
##  4 male_seeing_model   4.7
##  5 male_seeing_model   5.5
##  6 male_seeing_model   6  
##  7 male_seeing_model   4.4
##  8 male_seeing_model   6  
##  9 male_seeing_model   5.3
## 10 male_seeing_model   6.3
## # ... with 115 more rows
```

     

There were 5 treatment groups with 25 students in each, so there
should be, and are, $5 \times 25=125$ observations.


(b) Turn `treatment` into a `factor` in your data
frame. (You can use the same name as the text `treatment`
that you read in from the file.)

Solution


Thus:

```r
shirts <- shirts %>% mutate(treatment = factor(treatment))
```

     

and for checking:


```r

see that `treatment` is now definitely a factor rather than a
categorical variable represented as a piece of text.


(c) List the treatments in the order that they are in within
your `factor`. (There are lots of ways to do this; any one of
them except for `distinct` is good.)

Solution


This is the most direct:

```r
levels(shirts$treatment)
```

```
## [1] "control"               "female_seeing_model"   "female_seeing_student"
## [4] "male_seeing_model"     "male_seeing_student"
```

     

or you can do one of the `tidyverse`-style ways, such as


```r
shirts %>% count(treatment)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 2
##   treatment                 n
##   <fct>                 <int>
## 1 control                  25
## 2 female_seeing_model      25
## 3 female_seeing_student    25
## 4 male_seeing_model        25
## 5 male_seeing_student      25
```

 

or


```r
shirts %>% distinct(treatment)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 1
##   treatment            
##   <fct>                
## 1 male_seeing_model    
## 2 male_seeing_student  
## 3 female_seeing_model  
## 4 female_seeing_student
## 5 control
```

 

except that `distinct` shows you the values in the order that
they appear in the data file, which is *not* the order that they
appear in the factor. So that's why I asked you not to do it that way.

Alphabetical order,  is the moral of the story.

Extra: you can make them appear in the order they appear in the data,
if you want to (and if you know what you are doing):


```r
d <- shirts %>% mutate(trt2 = fct_inorder(treatment))
levels(d$trt2)
```

```
## [1] "male_seeing_model"     "male_seeing_student"   "female_seeing_model"  
## [4] "female_seeing_student" "control"
```

 

`fct_inorder` *creates* a factor whose levels are in the
order that they appeared in the data. If this is what you want, you
can go ahead and do this, and use this order when you create your
contrasts. It will work, and it will be good even though your
contrasts will look different from mine.


(d) <a name="part:mean-eval">*</a> 
Obtain a table of mean evaluation scores for each treatment group.
  

Solution


We will use this later when assessing the significance of the
contrasts. It's the usual group-by and summarize:

```r
shirts %>% group_by(treatment) %>% summarize(m = mean(score))
```

```
## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 2
##   treatment                 m
##   <fct>                 <dbl>
## 1 control                4.03
## 2 female_seeing_model    4.07
## 3 female_seeing_student  3.36
## 4 male_seeing_model      5.42
## 5 male_seeing_student    3.25
```

     

Extra: how does this come out if you have your factor levels in a
non-alphabetical order?


```r
d %>% group_by(trt2) %>% summarize(m = mean(score))
```

```
## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 2
##   trt2                      m
##   <fct>                 <dbl>
## 1 male_seeing_model      5.42
## 2 male_seeing_student    3.25
## 3 female_seeing_model    4.07
## 4 female_seeing_student  3.36
## 5 control                4.03
```

 

Ah, it respects the order of the levels of the factor: that is to say,
the treatment groups appear here in the order that they were in the
data, because the factor `trt2` was created to make that
happen.

`forcats` has other tools to re-order the levels of a factor,
lump factor levels together to make a category "other", and so
on. These also work if you start with a categorical variable as text:
it *creates* a factor with those properties.
  

(e) The experimenters wanted to compare four specific things in
their analysis:


* evaluation scores between male students who saw a (female) model and
male students who saw a (female) student

* evaluation scores between female students who saw a (female)
model and female students who saw a (female) student

* evaluation scores for male and for female students (overall)

* evaluation scores for the (average of the) four genuine
treatments and for the control group

Create contrasts, with suitable names, using vectors with
appropriate values.
  

Solution


These, in that order, are comparisons of treatments 4 and 5:

```r
c_mms <- c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1)
```

   

treatments 2 and 3:


```r
c_fms <- c(0, 1, -1, 0, 0)
```

 

(in these two the 1 and $-1$ can also be the other way around)

the average of 2 and 3 vs.\ the average of 4 and 5:


```r
c_mf <- c(0, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5)
```

 

or you can use 1 and $-1$ instead of the 0.5s, or you can switch the
signs around. I like the 0.5 values to remind me it's an average of
two means.

Finally


```r
c_tc <- c(1, -0.25, -0.25, -0.25, -0.25)
```

 

or multiply through by 4 to get rid of the fractions, or have the
negative sign on the first one and positive signs on the others.

I tried to give the contrasts mnemonic but short names, so that I
would remember which was which.
  

(f) Pick two of your contrasts (doesn't matter which two) and
demonstrate that they are orthogonal.
  

Solution


Multiply them together (elementwise, which is what `*`
does) and add them up, showing that you get zero, for example:

```r
sum(c_mf * c_tc)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

     

Check (mops brow).
  

(g) Collect all your contrasts together into a matrix and
declare that they are contrasts for `treatment` within your
data frame (whatever you called it).
  

Solution


I called my data frame `shirts`, so I need to do this:

```r
m <- cbind(c_mms, c_fms, c_mf, c_tc)
contrasts(shirts$treatment) <- m
```

       

There's no output here; we'll see in a moment whether it worked.

Extra: once you've created the matrix `m`, it gives you a
second way to test the contrasts for orthogonality, all at once:


```r
t(m) %*% m
```

```
##       c_mms c_fms c_mf c_tc
## c_mms     2     0    0 0.00
## c_fms     0     2    0 0.00
## c_mf      0     0    1 0.00
## c_tc      0     0    0 1.25
```

 

This matrix-multiplies the transpose of `m` by `m`, so
it's testing each column of `m` to see whether it's orthogonal
to each other column. The columns don't have to be orthogonal to
themselves, hence the non-zeros down the diagonal, but all the
off-diagonal entries are zero. Hence each contrast is orthogonal to
each other contrast.

Or even:


```r
z <- t(m) %*% m
all(z[row(z) != col(z)] == 0)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

 

That says (a little breathlessly) that it is true that all the
elements of $M^TM$ that are off the diagonal are zero.
\marginnote{The thing inside the square brackets says only to look at the elements of $M^TM$ whose row number and whose column number are different; it is perhaps easier to reason that elements of a matrix whose row number and column number are the *same* are *on* the diagonal, for example the element in row 2, column 2.}
  

(h) Predict evaluation score from 
treatment *as a  regression*, and display the results.
  

Solution


Once you have everything set up, it's just a matter of going
through the process:

```r
score.1 <- lm(score ~ treatment, data = shirts)
summary(score.1)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = score ~ treatment, data = shirts)
## 
## Residuals:
##    Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max 
## -3.860 -0.760  0.032  0.840  3.640 
## 
## Coefficients:
##                Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)      4.0256     0.1231  32.705  < 2e-16 ***

## treatmentc_fms   0.3540     0.1946   1.819   0.0714 .  
## treatmentc_mf   -0.6200     0.2752  -2.253   0.0261 *  
## treatmentc_tc    0.0064     0.2462   0.026   0.9793    
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 1.376 on 120 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.2467,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.2216 
## F-statistic: 9.823 on 4 and 120 DF,  p-value: 6.576e-07
```

       

Note how the contrasts have appeared as "slopes" in our
regression. (If this didn't happen for you, go back and check what you
did. Probably something gave you an error before, in that case.)

Your slopes can differ in terms of sign and possibly value from mine,
but the $t$-statistics and P-values should be the same as mine.
  

(i) For each of your contrasts, assess whether or not it is
significant, and explain briefly what that means in the context of the
data. If a contrast is significant, use your answer to
part (<a href="#part:mean-eval">here</a>) to help in your interpretation. 
    

Solution


I'll take my four contrasts as they appear in the output from `lm`:


* Comparing the male students who saw the model with those
who saw the student: this is strongly significant, and the
table of means shows that the males who saw the model rated
the shirt significantly *higher* than those who saw the
"average-looking" female student.

* Comparing the female students who saw the model with
those who saw the student: this difference is not quite
significant, so we conclude that it didn't matter who the
female students saw coming out of the dressing room.

* There is a significant difference between the average
evaluation score that males gave to the shirt and that
females did. The table of means reveals that the male
average was higher, mostly because males *really* liked
the shirt when they thought the model had been wearing it!

* There is no significant difference overall between
treatment and control groups in terms of average
score. (This is mostly because the treatment groups differ
among themselves, with the scores for students who saw the
model being higher and those for students who saw the female
student being lower than for the control group.)

It is enough, on the non-significant ones, to say what it is
that the contrast is testing, and then to note that it is not
significant. On the significant ones, I want you to say what
is higher than what.
You can also get these conclusions from the `lm`
output, but it requires a bit more care:


* I set up `c_mms` with the score for the students
who had seen the model as plus and those who saw the student
as minus. My slope here is positive, so the score for
male students who saw the model is higher.

* My slope for `c_fms` is also positive, and I set
this one up the same way with model as positive and student
as negative, so the female students rated the shirt higher
(but not significantly higher) when they saw the model.

* My `c_mf` slope is significantly negative. I set
up this contrast with females as plus and males as minus, so
this means males gave a significantly *higher* score on
average (for reasons discussed above).

* The last slope is very close to 0, consistent with there
being no difference (on average) between treatment and control.

Perhaps the story to get from this analysis is that male
students are *such* suckers!
    






##  Productivity and research-and-development


 An economist compiled data on productivity improvements for
a sample of companies that produce electronic equipment. The companies
were classified according to their expenditures on research and
development in the last three years (classified as low, moderate,
high). Productivity improvement is measured on a 0--100 scale, with
most values being between 0 and 10. The economist also thought that
last year's productivity improvement would be relevant, and so
recorded this as well.

The data set can be found at
[link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/productivity.txt). 

Feel free to use "R\&D" as an abbreviation for 
"research and development" in your answers below.



(a) Read in and display at least some of the data.

Solution


The data values are separated by one space, so let's use
`read_delim` and display whatever displays (probably the
first ten lines):

```r
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/productivity.txt"
productivity <- read_delim(my_url, " ")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   expenditure = col_character(),
##   improvement = col_double(),
##   last = col_double()
## )
```

```r
productivity
```

```
## # A tibble: 27 x 3
##    expenditure improvement  last
##    <chr>             <dbl> <dbl>
##  1 low                 7.6   8.2
##  2 low                 8.2   7.9
##  3 low                 6.8   7  
##  4 low                 5.8   5.7
##  5 low                 6.9   7.2
##  6 low                 6.6   7  
##  7 low                 6.3   6.5
##  8 low                 7.7   7.9
##  9 low                 6     6.3
## 10 moderate            6.7   8.8
## # ... with 17 more rows
```

   

There is a column classifying expenditure along with numerical values
for productivity improvement for this year and last year (labelled
`improvement` and `last`), so it looks as if we are
good.

You are free to give the data frame a shorter name to make it easier
to keep typing it!

Extra: those expenditure levels (that are currently text) will get
sorted into alphabetical order unless we stop them. They are actually
in the right order in the data file, so maybe we should turn them into
a factor (with the levels in the right order) now:


```r
productivity <- productivity %>% mutate(expenditure = fct_inorder(expenditure))
```

 

If you don't do this, your answers below will be different from
mine. Probably not in any kind of consequential way, but different
nonetheless.


(b) Plot productivity improvement for this year against last
year, identifying the points by the level of
research-and-development expenditure. On your plot, add regression
lines for each expenditure group.

Solution


Two quantitative and one categorical variable, so plot the
categorical variable using colour (or `shape` etc., if you
know about that, but colour is the most obvious thing):

```r
ggplot(productivity, aes(x = last, y = improvement, colour = expenditure)) + geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-95-1} 

     

The `se=F` is optional; no problem if you don't include it. (If
you miss it out, you'll get those CI-of-mean-response grey envelopes
around each line.)


(c) <a name="part:graph-comment">*</a> 
Look at your graph of the previous part. Do you think that (i)
knowing last year's productivity improvement tells you something
about this year's, (ii) the level of expenditure on
research-and-development has an impact on this year's productivity
improvement, (iii) there is an interaction effect between R\&D
expenditure and last year's productivity increase on this year's
productivity increase? In each case, explain briefly.

Solution


Taking the three things in turn:
(i) knowing about last year's productivity increase definitely
helps, because the three trends definitely go up (extra: and are
pretty much linear).
(ii) knowing about the level of expenditure helps because the
coloured trends are in different places (low on the
left and high on the right, whatever colours they are for you).
(iii) I am guessing there is no interaction because the three
lines look more or less parallel (a judgement call: if you think
that there *will* be an interaction because you think the
lines are definitely not "approximately parallel" and therefore
there is an interaction, that's OK too).


(d) Fit an analysis of covariance model without interaction. Run
the results through `drop1` with `test="F"` (the
`F` must be in quotes). What do you conclude?

Solution


This looks exactly like a regression with a categorical variable,
and is. Just the two main effects, thus:

```r
improvement.1 <- lm(improvement ~ last + expenditure, data = productivity)
drop1(improvement.1, test = "F")
```

```
## Single term deletions
## 
## Model:
## improvement ~ last + expenditure
##             Df Sum of Sq     RSS     AIC F value    Pr(>F)    
## <none>                    1.3175 -73.542                      
## last         1   14.0447 15.3622  -9.226 245.176 9.274e-14 ***
## expenditure  2    4.1958  5.5134 -38.894  36.623 7.095e-08 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

     

Both the P-values are small, so there is strong evidence of an effect
on this year's productivity increase of last year's productivity
increase and the level of R\&D expenditure. 


(e) Now look at the `summary` of your analysis of
covariance model. Explain briefly how each of the *last three*
numbers in the `Estimate` column are consistent with your graph.

Solution


To begin:

```r
summary(improvement.1)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = improvement ~ last + expenditure, data = productivity)
## 
## Residuals:
##      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
## -0.52812 -0.16385 -0.00046  0.08379  0.45730 
## 
## Coefficients:
##                     Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)         -1.00804    0.50991  -1.977   0.0602 .  
## last                 1.11417    0.07116  15.658 9.27e-14 ***
## expendituremoderate -1.83316    0.22372  -8.194 2.84e-08 ***
## expenditurehigh     -3.14338    0.37115  -8.469 1.59e-08 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 0.2393 on 23 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.9629,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.958 
## F-statistic: 198.8 on 3 and 23 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

     

The last three numbers in the Estimate column are slopes for the
quantitative variable `last` and changes in intercept for the
levels of the categorical variable `expenditure`. Specifically:



* the slope for `last` is positive, so if last year's
productivity increase is higher, so will this year's. This matches
the upward trends within each `expenditure` group on the
graph.

* `expenditure` is categorical, so everything is measured
relative to the baseline. Mine is `low`, but yours is probably `high`. 

* My two estimates for `expenditure` `high` and
`moderate` are both negative, so when expenditure on R\&D is
high or moderate, the productivity increase will be lower this year
(for the same productivity increase last year). Going back to the
graph, if you extend the lines for `moderate` and `high` to
a middling `last` value of something like 10, the
productivity increase this year will be higher when
`expenditure` is low or moderate then when it is high, which
is consistent with those slopes both being positive. (You don't need
to go to this detail, but you should say something convincing from
the graph about how this year's productivity increase is
*higher* if R\&D expenditure is low or moderate compared to
high.)


Extra: the graph also indicates that the higher the
`expenditure` on R\&D is, the more likely last year's
productivity improvement will be higher also. So in practice we are
not likely to be comparing actual companies with different
`expenditure` but the same `last`. Nonetheless, what I
said is what those positive coefficients for `expenditure`
actually mean. Be careful not to say that `low` is lowest
because it's on the left; it's whether it's higher or lower than the
others *at the same value of `last`* that matters.

Extra extra: I asked you to do the test from `drop1` because
there are three levels of `expenditure` (rather than just two),
and the `summary` output only gives you a comparison with the
baseline level, rather than comparing all three
levels. I prefer to do the right test (using `drop1`) first,
and then use `summary` to interpret what I have, or at least
the parts of it that are significant.

Extra extra extra: you would (or at least I would) expect a larger
productivity increase to go with a *larger* expenditure on R\&D,
but that's not how it worked out. This is one of those cases where all
else isn't really equal.


(f) Add an interaction between `last` and
`expenditure` to your analysis of covariance model. Test it
for significance using `drop1`. In the light of what you
have seen, does this surprise you? Explain briefly why you are or
are not surprised.

Solution


I like `update` for this (writing out the whole model is an
alternative):

```r
improvement.2 <- update(improvement.1, . ~ . + last:expenditure)
drop1(improvement.2, test = "F")
```

```
## Single term deletions
## 
## Model:
## improvement ~ last + expenditure + last:expenditure
##                  Df Sum of Sq     RSS     AIC F value  Pr(>F)  
## <none>                        0.95718 -78.169                  
## last:expenditure  2   0.36035 1.31753 -73.542   3.953 0.03491 *
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

     

Yes, I too forgot the `test="F"` the first time.

The interaction term is actually significant, at least at
$\alpha=0.05$. This is a surprise to me, because I thought those lines
on the graph were pretty close to parallel, so I wasn't expecting to
see a significant interaction. (What I want from you here is to look
back at your answer to (iii) in part (<a href="#part:graph-comment">here</a>), and
to say how this small P-value is consistent or inconsistent with
whatever you said there. If you said that the lines weren't parallel
enough, then this significant interaction should *not* be a
surprise to you.)

That's all I'm after. I don't need you to speculate on *why* the
test came out significant. I will, in a moment, but you don't need to.

Extra: I didn't expect the interaction to come out significant, but
the P-value is not nearly so small as the ones we had before. I guess
the explanation for this is that the data cluster pretty tightly about
the lines in the graph, so that even a small difference in slopes can
be signficant. You might argue that my red line is not *quite*
as steep as the others, but the difference does look very small.

Let's take a look at the `summary` for my interaction model:


```r
summary(improvement.2)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = improvement ~ last + expenditure + last:expenditure, 
##     data = productivity)
##

The last two Estimates, the ones beginning with `last:`, came
from the interaction. Once again `low` is my baseline. These
say how the *slopes* for `last` for the other groups
differ from the slopes for `last` for `low`
expenditure. (Yes, this is confusing. Read it again until you get it.)

The biggest-size difference in slopes, about $0.40$, is between low
expenditure and high expenditure. This says that the line for high
expenditure is this much more steep than the line for low
expenditure. That's where the non-parallelism is on the graph, such as
it is. A small but significant difference in slopes. You can tell that
the effect is small by looking in the Estimate column; those changes
in slopes, $0.40$ and $0.32$, are the smallest things in size out of
everything in that column.

Having seen this, you now realize that I did this question wrong (or,
at least, I led you through it wrong). The right way to do this would
have been to fit the interaction model *first*, see that it is
significant, and then done some predictions to assess the effects of
things: 


```r
lasts <- c(7, 9, 11)
expenditures <- c("low", "moderate", "high")
new <- crossing(last = lasts, expenditure = expenditures)
new
```

```
## # A tibble: 9 x 2
##    last expenditure
##   <dbl> <chr>      
## 1     7 high       
## 2     7 low        
## 3     7 moderate   
## 4     9 high       
## 5     9 low        
## 6     9 moderate   
## 7    11 high       
## 8    11 low        
## 9    11 moderate
```

 

(oh, how I wish I'd given those variables shorter names),
\marginnote{The expenditure levels have come out in alphabetical order again.} and then:


```r
p <- predict(improvement.2, new)
cbind(new, p)
```

```
##   last expenditure         p
## 1    7        high  2.517338
## 2    7         low  6.805256
## 3    7    moderate  4.557743
## 4    9        high  5.199343
## 5    9         low  8.670110
## 6    9    moderate  7.066929
## 7   11        high  7.881348
## 8   11         low 10.534963
## 9   11    moderate  9.576115
```

 

The effect is more or less as we described it before: as `last`
goes up (for fixed `expenditure`), the predicted productivity
improvements for this year go up, and as `expenditure` level
goes up, the predictions go *down*. But the rates at which they
go up or down are different, which is the significant interaction
coming into play. Having said that, they are not very different, so I
cheated and pretended the interaction was not significant (or that I
was using $\alpha=0.01$), so that you would have something easier to
interpret. Qualitatively, the story is the same either way, because
the sizes of the interaction terms are small compared to the
others. So, even though I cheated, you ended up with more or less the
same conclusions doing it the way I asked you to do it, or doing it
the way I just did it.





##  Treating leprosy


 Two drugs are being tested in the treatment of
leprosy. These are labelled A and D. There is also a control drug,
labelled F. The response variable is a post-treatment score of leprosy
bacilli (measured at six different sites on each patient). A lower
score is better.

Thus far, we have a standard one-way analysis of variance. But the
researchers wanted greater precision in assessing the effects (if any)
of the drugs, so they also measured a pre-treatment score of leprosy
bacilli. The data are in the file
[link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/leprosy.txt). The
pre-treatment and post-treatment scores are labelled `pre` and
`post` respectively.



(a) Read in the data and check that you have apparently the
right thing.


   
 
Solution


Take a look at the data file. The values have multiple spaces
between them, but they are aligned with each other and the
column headings, so `read_table` is the thing:

```r
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/leprosy.txt"
lepro <- read_table(my_url)
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   drug = col_character(),
##   pre = col_double(),
##   post = col_double()
## )
```

```r
lepro
```

```
## # A tibble: 30 x 3
##    drug    pre  post
##    <chr> <dbl> <dbl>
##  1 A        11     6
##  2 A         6     4
##  3 D         6     0
##  4 D         8     4
##  5 F        16    13
##  6 F        16    12
##  7 A         8     0
##  8 A        10    13
##  9 D         6     2
## 10 D        19    14
## # ... with 20 more rows
```

 

Call it what you like.

That looks good, with variables of the right names. 
 

(b) <a name="part:lepro-scatter">*</a> Make a scatterplot of post-treatment score against
pre-treatment score, with the points for each drug drawn in a
different colour. 
 
Solution


This is the kind of thing that `ggplot` does without
batting an eyelid:

```r
ggplot(lepro, aes(x = pre, y = post, colour = drug)) + geom_point()
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-104-1} 

       
 

(c) Does it appear that including the pre-treatment score was a
good idea? Explain briefly.
 
Solution


The overall trend on the scatterplot is that a higher `pre`
tends to go with a higher `post`, regardless of drug, so
including this information appears to be informative.
I personally suspect that there's some fan-out happening on the
pre-post relationship, but I'm not planning to make you explore that.
 

(d) What about this dataset suggests that analysis of
covariance is a method worth trying?
 
Solution


The key is a mixture of categorical and quantitative explanatory
variables. Here we have a categorical variable `drug` and a
quantitative one `pre`. 
If we had only one type of explanatory variable, we could do a
regression or an ANOVA as appropriate. But we don't. In some ways,
it's not worth making a fuss about the distinction, because
regressions and ANOVAs are all linear models anyway. But you may
see the term "analysis of covariance", so it's worth your while
to know what it's about. 
 

(e) Fit an analysis of covariance model to predict
post-treatment score. Include an interaction between your
explanatory variables. (You don't need to look at the output from
the model.)
 
Solution


This is what you'd guess. `lm` handles the interaction
properly, even though `pre` is a  quantitative variable.


```r
lepro.1 <- lm(post ~ pre * drug, data = lepro)
```

     

I wanted to take a look, so I did:


```r
summary(lepro.1)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = post ~ pre * drug, data = lepro)
## 
## Residuals:
##    Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max 
## -6.225 -2.437 -0.586  1.126  8.775 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)  
## (Intercept)  -1.6306     2.9455  -0.554   0.5850  
## pre           0.7452     0.2849   2.616   0.0152 *
## drugD        -2.9549     4.1246  -0.716   0.4806  
## drugF        -1.4780     5.4678  -0.270   0.7892  
## pre:drugD     0.3233     0.3846   0.841   0.4089  
## pre:drugF     0.4492     0.4458   1.008   0.3236  
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 4.07 on 24 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.6915,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6272 
## F-statistic: 10.76 on 5 and 24 DF,  p-value: 1.63e-05
```

 

For testing the interaction, there are *two* slope coefficients
that should be zero if there is no interaction. So we have to test
this with `drop1`, which is next.
 

(f) Pass your fitted model of the last part into
`drop1`. Is
the interaction term significant?


Solution


Just this:

```r
drop1(lepro.1, test = "F")
```

```
## Single term deletions
## 
## Model:
## post ~ pre * drug
##          Df Sum of Sq    RSS    AIC F value Pr(>F)
## <none>                397.56 89.524               
## pre:drug  2    19.645 417.20 86.971   0.593 0.5606
```

       

There is only a test for the interaction term because you can't take out the main effects until you've taken out the interaction.

The P-value for the interaction is very large (0.5606) so it is
nowhere near significant. We can drop the interaction.



(g) Fit a model without the interaction. Is this a sensible thing to
do (in addition, that is, to the fact that I just asked you to do it)?


Solution


Change the `*` to a `+`:

```r
lepro.2 <- lm(post ~ pre + drug, data = lepro)
```

     

Or use `update` (not much in it, here):


```r
lepro.2a <- update(lepro.1, . ~ . - pre:drug)
```

 

We just said that the interaction could come out, since it wasn't
significant, so this is exactly the model that we should be fitting.



(h) Take a look at the `summary` of your preferred
model. Is there a significant effect of pre-treatment score?
Describe the effects of the different drugs on the post-treatment
score. (Don't do any tests for `drug`.) Does your comparison
of drugs make sense?
 
Solution


Mine was the no-interaction model `lepro.2`:

```r
summary(lepro.2)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = post ~ pre + drug, data = lepro)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -6.4115 -2.3891 -0.5711  1.7237  8.5885 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)  -3.8808     1.9862  -1.954   0.0616 .  
## pre           0.9872     0.1645   6.001 2.45e-06 ***
## drugD         0.1090     1.7951   0.061   0.9521    
## drugF         3.4461     1.8868   1.826   0.0793 .  
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 4.006 on 26 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.6763,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6389 
## F-statistic:  18.1 on 3 and 26 DF,  p-value: 1.501e-06
```

     

The pre-treatment term is definitely significant, with a P-value of
0.0000025. So pre-treatment score definitely has an impact on
post-treatment score.

I didn't ask you to test for significance of drugs. I just wanted you
to assess their coefficients. Drug A is being used as the baseline, so
its coefficient is zero. Drug D has a slightly positive coefficient
(0.109) so its average bacilli score is slightly higher (for any
pre-treatment score) than for drug A. Drug F, which was the placebo,
has a slope of 3.446, so its average bacilli score is a fair bit
higher than for either of the other drugs. This makes sense because a
higher score is worse, and the two "real" drugs are both better than
the fake one.

Whether there is a real drug difference, I didn't ask you to assess,
but you could do it by `drop1` again, this way:

```r
drop1(lepro.2, test = "F")
```

```
## Single term deletions
## 
## Model:
## post ~ pre + drug
##        Df Sum of Sq    RSS     AIC F value    Pr(>F)    
## <none>              417.20  86.971                      
## pre     1    577.90 995.10 111.049 36.0145 2.454e-06 ***
## drug    2     68.55 485.76  87.535  2.1361    0.1384    
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

 

This is actually not significant.
\marginnote{This is why I didn't ask you to test this, since it would have confused the story.}
This is one of those cases where the non-significant `drug` has
a slightly *bigger* AIC than `<none>`, so `drop1`
considers it best to leave it in the model.
 

(i) Obtain predicted values for `post` for each of the
three drugs at `pre` scores 5, 12 and 20. To do this, obtain
a new data frame that has all 9 combinations of drugs and
`pre` scores, and then feed this into `predict` using
your preferred model.
\marginnote{Analysis of covariance is just a linear  model, so *predict* works the same here as in regression.}
 
Solution


First, make the new data frame for predicting from, using
`crossing`. I'm doing this in small steps for clarity:
first, I define all the drugs and `pre` values, and then I
feed them into `crossing`:

```r
drugs <- c("A", "D", "F")
pres <- c(5, 12, 20)
lepro.new <- crossing(drug = drugs, pre = pres)
lepro.new
```

```
## # A tibble: 9 x 2
##   drug    pre
##   <chr> <dbl>
## 1 A         5
## 2 A        12
## 3 A        20
## 4 D         5
## 5 D        12
## 6 D        20
## 7 F         5
## 8 F        12
## 9 F        20
```

     

The names of the columns in the new data frame have to be
*exactly* `drug` and `pre`. Anything else, and
`predict` won't work.

Now I obtain the predictions, from my best model `lepro.2`. I
don't need intervals or anything like that:


```r
preds <- predict(lepro.2, lepro.new)
preds
```

```
##         1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8 
##  1.055110  7.965396 15.862867  1.164081  8.074368 15.971838  4.501248 11.411535 
##         9 
## 19.309005
```

 

only it would be easier to see the predictions side by side with the
values they are predictions for:


```r
allpreds <- cbind(lepro.new, preds)
allpreds
```

```
##   drug pre     preds
## 1    A   5  1.055110
## 2    A  12  7.965396
## 3    A  20 15.862867
## 4    D   5  1.164081
## 5    D  12  8.074368
## 6    D  20 15.971838
## 7    F   5  4.501248
## 8    F  12 11.411535
## 9    F  20 19.309005
```

 

I gave this a name in case I feel like using it again later.
 

(j) Now, plot the data with the fitted lines on. You'll need to do
the trick of using the original data frame (and plot the points),
and the data frame of predictions (and join those points with lines).
 
Solution




```r
ggplot(lepro, aes(x = pre, y = post, colour = drug)) + geom_point() + geom_line(data = allpreds, 
    aes(y = preds, linetype = drug))
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-115-1} 

 

Inside the `aes` for the `geom_line`, I only have to
specify the things that have changed, so that the `x`
(`pre`) and the `colour` (`drug`) are
"inherited" unchanged from the first `aes`.

`geom_line` has the `aes` as its default first argument,
so I have to specify `data=` by name.

The `linetype=` is really overkill, but I just wanted to show
you that you can distinguish the drugs by line type as
well.
\marginnote{The line types show up in the legend too, though they're not so easy to see.}
 

(k) Are the lines on your plot parallel, with the same slopes? Is this what you would
expect? Explain briefly.
 
Solution


My lines are parallel. This is exactly what I would expect, since
my best model has no interaction, and the interaction is what
would make the lines *not* be parallel. 
If your best model
*did* have the interaction term still in it, your predictions
would have been these:

```r
preds <- predict(lepro.1, lepro.new)
cbind(lepro.new, preds)
```

```
##   drug pre      preds
## 1    A   5  2.0955414
## 2    A  12  7.3121019
## 3    A  20 13.2738854
## 4    D   5  0.7572581
## 5    D  12  8.2370968
## 6    D  20 16.7854839
## 7    F   5  2.8637331
## 8    F  12 11.2249823
## 9    F  20 20.7806955
```

     

The slopes for each drug are no longer the same (because nothing is
forcing them to be the same). For example, if you compare drug A at
pre score 5 and 12, it goes up by 5.2, while drug D at the same pre
scores goes up by 7.5.

The `ggplot` in this case is actually a lot easier than the
other `ggplot`, because the lines are now just the regression
lines for each group.  So `geom_smooth` will get them:


```r
ggplot(lepro, aes(x = pre, y = post, colour = drug)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'
```


\includegraphics{18-anova-revisited_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-117-1} 

 

The grey intervals are a bit confusing.
\marginnote{You can get rid of them by saying *se=F* inside the geom-smooth, as normal.} They are
confidence intervals for the mean `post` score (as we did for regression
early on in the course). But I left them there to show that they
overlap substantially and thus that those slopes are not 
"really different". That's the lack of interaction. There is, as you see, a
substantial scatter in the points that would make it very difficult to
prove that those three slopes are really different.
