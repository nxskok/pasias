<div id="getting-started" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Getting started</h2>
<p>This question is to get you started using R.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Start R Studio Cloud, in some project. (If you started up a
new project in the previous question and are still logged in, use
that; if not, create a new project.)</p></li>
<li><p>We’re going to do some stuff in R here, just to get used to
it. First, make an R Notebook by selecting File, New File and R
Notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the title to something of your choosing. Then go down
to line 5, click on the Insert button and select R. You should see
a “code chunk” appear at line 5, which we are going to use in a
moment.</p></li>
<li><p>Type the line of code shown below into the chunk in the
R Notebook:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>
mtcars
</code></pre>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Run this command. To do that, look at the top right of
your code chunk block (shaded in a slightly different colour). You
should see a gear symbol, a down arrow and a green “play button”.
Click the play button. This will run the code, and show
the output below the code chunk.</p></li>
<li><p>Something a little more interesting: <code>summary</code>
obtains a summary of whatever you feed it (the five-number summary
plus the mean for numerical variables). Obtain this for our data
frame. To do this, create a new code chunk below the previous one,
type <code>summary(mtcars)</code> into the code chunk, and run it.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s make a boxplot of the gas mileage data. This is a
“poor man’s boxplot”; we’ll see a nicer-looking way later. To do it
this way, make another new code chunk, enter the code
<code>boxplot(mtcars$mpg)</code> into it, and run the chunk.</p></li>
<li><p>Some aesthetics to finish with: delete the template notebook
(all the stuff you didn’t type below your code chunks and
output). Then add some narrative text above and below your code
chunks. Above the code chunk is where you say what you are going
to do (and maybe why you are doing it), and below is where you say
what you conclude from the output you just obtained.</p></li>
<li><p>Save your notebook (the usual way with File and Save). This
saves it <em>on the R Studio Cloud servers</em> (and not on your
computer). This means that when you come back to R Studio Cloud
later, even from another device, this notebook will still be
available to you.
Now click Preview. This produces a pretty HTML version of your
notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Optional extra: practice handing in your previewed R
notebook, as if it were an assignment that was worth
something. (It is good to get the practice in a low-stakes
situation, so that you’ll know what to do next week.)</p></li>
<li><p>Optional extra. Something more ambitious: make a scatterplot of gas
mileage <code>mpg</code>, on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis, against horsepower,
<code>hp</code>, on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="reading-data-from-a-file" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Reading data from a file</h2>
<p>In this question, we read a file from the web and do some
descriptive statistics and a graph. This is very like what you will be
doing on future assignments, so it’s good to practice it now.</p>
<p>Take a look at the data file at
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jumping.txt">http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jumping.txt</a>. These are
measurements on 30 rats that were randomly made to do different
amounts of jumping by group (we’ll see the details later in the
course). The control group did no jumping, and the other groups did
“low jumping” and “high jumping”. The first column says which
jumping group each rat was in, and the second is the rat’s bone
density (the experimenters’ supposition was that more jumping should
go with higher bone density).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>What are the two columns of data separated by? (The fancy word
is “delimited”).</p></li>
<li><p>Make a new R Notebook. Leave the first four lines, but get rid
of the rest of the template document. Start with a code chunk
containing <code>library(tidyverse)</code>. Run it.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the URL of the data file in a variable called
<code>my_url</code>. Then use <code>read_delim</code> to read in the
file. (See solutions for how.) <code>read_delim</code> reads data files
where the data values are always separated by the same single
character, here a space. Save the data frame in a variable <code>rats</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a look at your data frame, by making a new code chunk and
putting the data frame’s name in it (as we did with
<code>mtcars</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Find the mean bone density for rats that did each amount of jumping.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a boxplot of bone density for each jumping group.</p></li>
</ol>

<div id="reading-files-different-ways" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Reading files different ways</h2>
<p>This question is about different ways of reading data files. If you’re using R Studio Cloud (online), start at the beginning. If you’re using R Studio running on your own computer, start at part (<a href="#part:own-start">here</a>).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Log in to R Studio Cloud. Open up a project (or start a new
one), and watch the spinning circles for a few minutes. When that’s
done, create a new R Notebook with File, New File, R
Notebook. Delete the “template” notebook, but not the top four
lines with <code>title:</code>
and <code>output:</code> in them. Add a code chunk that contains <code>library(tidyverse)</code> and run it.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="part:internet-file">*</a> The easiest kind of files to read
in are ones on the Internet, with a URL address that begins with
<code>http</code>
or <code>https</code>. I have a small file at
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/testing.txt">link</a>. Click
the link to see it, and keep the tab open for the next part of this question.
This is a text file with three things on each
line, each separated by exactly one space. Read the data file into a
data frame, and display your data frame.</p></li>
<li><p>You might have data in a file on your own computer. To read
data from such a file, you first have to <em>upload</em> it to R
Studio Cloud, and then read it from there. To practice this: open a
text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit). Go back to the web browser
tab containing the data you used in the previous part. Copy the data
from there and paste it into the text editor. Save it somewhere on
your computer (like the Desktop). Upload that file to R Studio
Cloud, read in the data and verify that you get the right</p></li>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>If you’re happy with using your Google account, click that
button. You will probably have to enter your Google password. (If
you are doing this on your own computer, you might not have to do
that.) If you have a GitHub account and you want to use
<em>that</em>, same principle.
You can also use an email address as your login to R Studio
Cloud. (You can use any e-mail address; I’m not checking.) Enter
it in the top box, and enter a password to use with R Studio Cloud
in the second. (This does not have to be, and indeed probably
should not be, the same as your email password.) Below that,
enter your first and last name. This will appear at the top right
of the screen when you are logged in. Then click Sign Up. After
that, you will have to make a unique account name (which
<em>you</em> actually never use, but which
<code>rstudio.cloud</code> uses to
name your files).
After that, you are automatically logged in.</p>

<p>This lets it install a bunch of things. It may take some

<p>Solution</p>
<p>You ought to see something like this. I have a dark blue
background here, which you probably do not.</p>
<p><img src="empty.png" /></p>
<p>It won’t look exactly like that (for example, the background
will probably be white) but there should be one thing
on the left half, and at the top
right it’ll say “Environment is empty”.
Extra: if you want to tweak things, select Tools (at the top of
the screen) and from it Global Options, then click
Appearance. You can make the text bigger or smaller via Editor
Font Size, and choose a different colour scheme by picking one
of the Editor Themes (which previews on the right). My favourite
is Tomorrow Night Blue. Click Apply or OK when you have found
something you like. (I spend a lot of time in R Studio, and I

Yes. After that, you’ll have this:</p>
<p><img src="rnote1.png" /></p>
<p>Find the Insert and Run buttons along the top of the R Notebook

<p>Here’s what I get (yours will be the same).</p>
<p><img src="chunk3.png" /></p>
<p>This is a rectangular array of rows and columns, with
individuals in rows and variables in columns, known as a
“data frame”. When you display a data frame in an R Notebook, you see
10 rows and as many columns as will fit on the screen. At the
bottom, it says how many rows and columns there are altogether
(here 32 rows and 11 columns), and which ones are being
displayed. You can see more rows by clicking on Next, and if
there are more columns, you’ll see a little arrow next to the
rightmost column (as here next to <code>am</code>) that you can
click on to see more columns. Try it and see. Or if you want to
go to a particular collection of rows, click one of the numbers
between Previous and Next: 1 is rows 1–10, 2 is rows 11–20,
and so on.
The column on the left without a header (containing the names of
the cars) is called “row names”. These have a funny kind of
status, kind of a column and kind of not a column; usually, if
we need to use the names, we have to put them in a column first.

<p>If you don’t see the “play button”, make sure that what you have
really is a code chunk. (I often accidentally delete one of the
special characters above or below the code chunk). If you can’t figure
it out, delete this code chunk and make a new one. Sometimes R Studio
gets confused.</p>
<p>On the code chunk, the other symbols are the settings for this chunk
(you have the choice to display or not display the code or the output
or to not actually run the code). The second one, the down arrow, runs
all the chunks prior to this one (but not this one).</p>
<p>The output has its own little buttons. The first one pops the output
out into its own window; the second one shows or hides the output, and
the third one deletes the output (so that you have to run the chunk
again to get it back). Experiment. You can’t do much damage here.</p>

<p>For the gas mileage column <code>mpg</code>, the mean is bigger than the
median, and the largest value is unusually large compared with the
others, suggesting a distribution that is skewed to the right.</p>
<p>There are 11 numeric (quantitative) variables, so we get the
five-number summary plus mean for each one. Categorical variables, if
we had any here, would be displayed a different way.</p>
<p>(In case you are wondering, the way without screenshots is obtained by

<p>My complete R Notebook is at
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/a0-notebook-1.Rmd">http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/a0-notebook-1.Rmd</a>. Take
a look at it. I added one extra thing: my variable names have
“backticks” around them. You’ll see the effect of this in a
moment. Backtick is on the key to the left of 1 and below Esc
on your keyboard, along with a “squiggle” symbol that we’ll be
using later in the course.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Save your notebook (the usual way with File and Save). This
saves it <em>on the R Studio Cloud servers</em> (and not on your
computer). This means that when you come back to R Studio Cloud
later, even from another device, this notebook will still be
available to you.
Now click Preview. This produces a pretty HTML version of your
notebook.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Note that the HTML document only contains output from the chunks
you’ve run in the notebook, so it’s up to you to run them there
first.<br />
My HTML document is at
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/a0-notebook-1.nb.html">http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/a0-notebook-1.nb.html</a>.
Here’s where you see the effect of the backticks: all the
variable names are in <code>typewriter font</code> so that you can
see they are variable names and not something else. If you want
to try this notebook out yourself, you have a couple of options:
(i) make a new R Notebook on R Studio Cloud and copy-paste the
contents of my file (it’s just text), or (ii) download my R
Notebook onto your computer, and then upload it to R Studio
Cloud. Look in the Files pane bottom right, and next to New
Folder you should see Upload. Upload the file from wherever it
got saved to when you downloaded it.
Extra: if you’re feeling ambitious, click the arrow to the right
of Preview and select Knit to Word. The button changes to Knit
with a ball of wool beside it. Now, when you “knit” the
notebook, you get a Word document directly — look for it in
the Files pane. If you want to, you can hand this kind of thing
in (on later assignments), but you’ll have to do a little work
first: first, find it in your Files list, then click the
checkbox to the left of it, then click More (with the gear, on
the same line as New Folder and Upload), then select Export (and
click Download). This will put a copy in your downloads folder
on your computer, and you can open it from there.
If you’re feeling extra-ambitious, you can try Knit to PDF. This
produces something that looks as if it was written in LaTeX,
but actually wasn’t. To make this work, if you have a
<code>library(tidyverse)</code> line somewhere, as you probably
will, find the code chunk it’s in, and make it look like this:</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_2018-10-10_17-24-47.png" /></p>
<p>Then it will work.
Extra extra: if you like the keyboard better than the mouse, R
Studio has a lot of keyboard shortcuts. Two that are useful now:
control-alt-i inserts a code chunk where the
cursor is, and control-shift-enter runs the code chunk that the
cursor is in, if it is in one. (Mac users, “command” instead
of “control” in both cases.) I use these two a lot.</p>

<li>Optional extra: practice handing in your previewed R
notebook, as if it were an assignment that was worth
something. (It is good to get the practice in a low-stakes
situation, so that you’ll know what to do next week.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>There are two steps: download the HTML file onto your computer,
and then handing it in on Quercus.
To download: find the HTML file that you want to download in the
Files pane bottom right. There should be two files starting with
the same thing, eg. <code>test1.Rmd</code>, which is the notebook
you wrote, and <code>test1.nb.html</code>, which is the previewed
version of it, and is the one you want to download. (The
<code>test1</code> part is the name <em>you</em> chose when you saved
it.) Click the checkbox to the left of the HTML file.
Now click on More above the bottom-right pane. This pops up a
menu from which you choose Export. This will pop up another
window called Export Files, where you put the name that the file
will have on your computer. (I usually leave the name the same.)
Click Download. The file will go to your Downloads folder, or
wherever things you download off the web go.
Now, to hand it in. Open up Quercus at <code>q.utoronto.ca</code>,
log in and navigate to this course. Click Assignments. Click
(the title of) Assignment 0. There is a big blue Submit
Assignment button top right. Click it. You’ll get a File Upload
at the bottom of the screen.
Click Choose File and find the HTML file that you
downloaded. Click Open (or equivalent on your system). The name
of the file should appear next to Choose File. Click Submit
Assignment. You’ll see Submitted at the top right.
If you want to try this again, you can Re-submit Assignment as
many times as you like. (For the real thing, you can use this if
you realize you made a mistake in something you submitted. The
graders’ instructions, for the real thing, are to grade the
<em>last</em> file submitted, so in that case you need to make
sure that the last thing submitted includes <em>everything</em>
that you want graded. Here, though, it doesn’t matter.)</p>

<code>hp</code>, on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>That goes like this. I’ll explain the steps below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb11-1" title="1"><span class="kw">library</span>(tidyverse)</a>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-86-1.png" width="672"  />
$ %$ %$</p>
<p>This shows a somewhat downward trend, which is what you’d expect,
since a larger <code>hp</code> value means a more powerful engine, which
will probably consume more gas and get <em>fewer</em> miles per gallon.
As for the code: to make a <code>ggplot</code> plot, as we will shortly
see in class, you first need a <code>ggplot</code> statement that says
what to plot. The first thing in a <code>ggplot</code> is a data frame
(<code>mtcars</code> here), and then the <code>aes</code> says that the plot
will have <code>hp</code> on the
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis and <code>mpg</code> on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis, taken from the data frame
that you specified. That’s all of the what-to-plot. The last thing is
how to plot it; <code>geom_point()</code> says to plot the data values as
points.</p>
<p>You might like to add a regression line to the plot. That is a matter
of adding this to the end of the plotting command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb12-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(mtcars, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span>hp, <span class="dt">y=</span>mpg))<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>(<span class="dt">method=</span><span class="st">&quot;lm&quot;</span>)</a></code></pre></div>

<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jumping.txt">http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jumping.txt</a>. These are
measurements on 30 rats that were randomly made to do different
amounts of jumping by group (we’ll see the details later in the
course). The control group did no jumping, and the other groups did
“low jumping” and “high jumping”. The first column says which
jumping group each rat was in, and the second is the rat’s bone
density (the experimenters’ supposition was that more jumping should
go with higher bone density).</p>

<li>Make a boxplot of bone density for each jumping group.</li>

<p>On a boxplot, the groups go across and the values go up and down,

<p>Given the amount of variability, the control and low-jump groups are
very similar (with the control group having a couple of outliers), but
the high-jump group seems to have a consistently higher bone density
than the others.</p>

guessing, but it seems that it has to be high jumping to make a

<p>When you run that, you’ll see something like my output. The first part
is <code>read_delim</code> telling you what it saw in the file: two
columns of (whole) numbers and one column of text. The top line of the
file is assumed to contain names, which are used as the names of the
columns of your data frame. The bottom part of the output, obtained by
putting the name of the data frame on a line by itself in your code
chunk, is what the data frame actually looks like. You ought to get
into the habit of eyeballing it and checking that it looks like the
values in the data file.</p>
<p>The things on the left side of the equals signs are variables that you
are creating in R. You get to choose the names for them. My habit is
to use <code>my_url</code> for URLs of files that I am going to read in,
and (usually) to give my data frames names that say something about
what they contain, but this is your choice to make.</p>

<li>You might have data in a file on your own computer. To read
data from such a file, you first have to <em>upload</em> it to R
Studio Cloud, and then read it from there. To practice this: open a
text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit). Go back to the web browser
tab containing the data you used in the previous part. Copy the data
from there and paste it into the text editor. Save it somewhere on
your computer (like the Desktop). Upload that file to R Studio
Cloud, read in the data and verify that you get the right
thing. (For this last part, see the Solution.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I copied and pasted the data, and saved it in a file called
<code>testing.txt</code> on my computer. I’m assuming that you’ve
given it a similar name.
Then go back to R Studio Cloud. You should have a Files pane
bottom right. If you don’t see a pane bottom right at all, press
Control-Shift-0 to show all the panes. If you see something bottom
right but it’s not Files (for example a plot), click the Files
tab, and you should see a list of things that look like files, like this:</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_2019-01-10_12-29-48.png" /></p>
<p>Click the Upload button (next to New Folder), click Choose
File. Use the file finder to track down the file you saved on your
computer, then click OK. The file should be uploaded to the same
folder on R Studio Cloud that your project is, and appear in the
Files pane bottom right.
To read it in, you supply the file name to <code>read_delim</code> thus:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb23-1" title="1">testing2 &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">read_delim</span>(<span class="st">&quot;testing.txt&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot; &quot;</span>)</a></code></pre></div>

## cols(
##   x = col_double(),
##   y = col_double(),
##   g = col_character()
## )</code></pre>
<p>and then you look at it in the same way as before:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb25-1" title="1">testing2</a></code></pre></div>

<li>You might have a spreadsheet on your computer. Create a
<code>.csv</code> file from it, and use the ideas of the last part to
read it into R Studio Cloud.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Open the spreadsheet containing the data you want to read into
R. If there are several sheets in the workbook, make sure you’re
looking at the right one. Select File, Save As, select “CSV”
or “comma-separated values” and give it a name. Save the
resulting file somewhere.</p>
<p>Then follow the same steps as the previous part to upload it to
your project on R Studio Cloud. (If you look at the actual file,
it will be plain text with the data values having commas between
them, as the name suggests. You can open the file in R Studio
Cloud by clicking on it in the Files pane; it should open top
left.)</p>
<p>The final step is to read it into an R data frame. This uses
<code>read_csv</code>; there are several <code>read_</code> functions that
read in different types of file, and you need to use an appropriate
one.</p>

<p>You are now done with this question.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><a name="part:own-start">*</a> Start here if you downloaded R and R

Open a web browser and point it at
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/testing.txt">link</a>. Click

This is a text file with three things on each
line, each separated by exactly one space. Read the data file into a
data frame, and display your data frame.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Data values separated by exactly one space is the kind of thing that <code>read_delim</code> reads, so make another code chunk and fill it with this:</p>

<p>(This part is exactly the same whether you are running R Studio Cloud
or have R Studio running on your computer. A remote file is obtained
in exactly the same way regardless.)</p>

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>You might have data in a file on your own computer. To read data
from such a file, R has to know where to find it. Each R project lives
in a folder, and one way of specifying where a data file is is to give
its complete path relative to the folder that R Studio is running its
current project in. This is rather complicated, so we will try a
simpler way. To set this up, open a text editor (like Notepad or
TextEdit). Go back to the web browser tab containing the data you used
in the previous part. Copy the data from there and paste it into the
text editor. Save it somewhere on your computer (like the
Desktop). Follow the steps in the solution below to read the data
into R.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I copied and pasted the data, and saved it in a file called
<code>testing.txt</code> on my computer. I’m assuming that you’ve
given it a similar name.
Go back to R Studio. Create a new code chunk containing this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb32"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb32-1" title="1">f &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">file.choose</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Run this code chunk. You’ll see a file chooser. Find the file you
saved on your computer, and click Open (or OK or whatever you
see). This saves what R needs to access the file in the variable
<code>f</code>. If you want to, you can look at it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb33"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb33-1" title="1">f</a></code></pre></div>
<p>and you’ll see what looks like a file path in the appropriate format
for your system (Windows, Mac, Linux).
To read the data in, you supply the file path to <code>read_delim</code> thus:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb34"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb34-1" title="1">testing2 &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">read_delim</span>(f, <span class="st">&quot; &quot;</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>and then you look at it in the same way as before:</p>
