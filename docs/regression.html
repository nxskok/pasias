<p>These problems are about simple regression (just one <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variable):</p>
<div id="rainfall-in-california" class="section level2" number="14.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Rainfall in California</h2>
<p>The data in
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/calirain.txt">link</a> are
rainfall and other measurements for 30 weather stations in
California. Our aim is to understand how well the annual rainfall at
these stations (measured in inches) can be predicted from the other
measurements, which are the altitude (in feet above sea level), the
latitude (degrees north of the equator) and the distance from the
coast (in miles).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Read the data into R. You’ll have to be careful here, since the
values are space-delimited, but sometimes by more than one space, to
make the columns line up. <code>read_table2</code>, with filename or
url, will read it in.
One of the variables
is called <code>rainfall</code>, so as long as you <em>do not</em> call
the data frame that, you should be safe.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I used <code>rains</code> as the name of my data frame:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb940"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb940-1"><a href="regression.html#cb940-1"></a>my_url=<span class="st">&quot;http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/calirain.txt&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb940-2"><a href="regression.html#cb940-2"></a>rains=<span class="kw">read_table2</span>(my_url)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
## ── Column specification ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## cols(
##   station = col_character(),
##   rainfall = col_double(),
##   altitude = col_double(),
##   latitude = col_double(),
##   fromcoast = col_double()
## )</code></pre>
<p>I have the right number of rows and columns.</p>
<p>There is also <code>read_table</code>, but that requires <em>all</em> the
columns, including the header row, to be lined up. You can try that
here and see how it fails.</p>
<p>I don’t need you to investigate the data yet (that happens in the next
part), but this is interesting (to me):</p>

<p>Some of the station names are two words, but they have been smooshed
into one word, so that <code>read_table2</code> will recognize them as a
single thing. Someone had already done that for us, so I didn’t even
have to do it myself.</p>
<p>If the station names had been two genuine words, a <code>.csv</code> would
probably have been the best choice (the actual data values being
separated by commas then, and not spaces).</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Make a boxplot of the rainfall figures, and explain why the
values are reasonable. (A rainfall cannot be negative, and it is
unusual for a annual rainfall to exceed 60 inches.) A
<code>ggplot</code> boxplot needs <em>something</em> on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis: the
number 1 will do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb943"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb943-1"><a href="regression.html#cb943-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(rains,<span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">y=</span>rainfall,<span class="dt">x=</span><span class="dv">1</span>))<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-658-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>There is only one rainfall over 60 inches, and the smallest one is
close to zero but positive, so that is good.</p>
<p>Another possible plot here is a histogram, since there is only one quantitative variable:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb944"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb944-1"><a href="regression.html#cb944-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(rains, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span>rainfall))<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins=</span><span class="dv">7</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-659-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This clearly shows the rainfall value above 60 inches, but some other things are less clear: are those two rainfall values around 50 inches above or below 50, and are those six rainfall values near zero actually above zero?
Extra: What stations have those extreme values? Should you wish to find out:</p>

<p>This is a place right on the Pacific coast, almost up into Oregon (it’s almost
the northernmost of all the stations). So it makes sense that it would
have a high rainfall, if anywhere does. (If you know anything about
rainy places, you’ll probably think of Vancouver and Seattle, in the

<p>The name of the station is a clue: this one is in the desert. So you’d
expect very little rain. Its altitude is <em>negative</em>, so it’s
actually <em>below</em> sea level. This is correct. Here is where it is:

<p>You can add a smooth trend to these if you want. Up to you. Just the

<p>Here is a funky way to get all three plots in one shot:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-665-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This always seems extraordinarily strange if you haven’t run into it
before. The strategy is to put <em>all</em> the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variables you want
to plot into <em>one</em> column and then plot your <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> against the
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-column. Thus: make a column of all the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s glued
together, labelled by which <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> they are, then plot <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
but make a different sub-plot or “facet” for each different
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-name. The last thing is that each <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is measured on a different
scale, and unless we take steps, all the sub-plots will have the
<em>same</em> scale on each axis, which we don’t want.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I like how it came out, with three very tall
plots. <code>facet_wrap</code> can also take an <code>nrow</code> or an
<code>ncol</code>, which tells it how many rows or columns to use for the
display. Here, for example, two columns because I thought three was
too many:</p>

<p>Now, the three plots have come out about square, or at least “landscape”, which I like a lot better.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Look at the relationship of each other variable with
<code>rainfall</code>.
Justify the assertion that <code>latitude</code> seems most strongly
related with <code>rainfall</code>. Is that relationship positive or negative? linear? Explain
briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Let’s look at the three variables in turn:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>altitude</code>: not much of anything. The stations near
sea level have rainfall all over the place, though the three
highest-altitude stations have the three highest rainfalls apart
from Crescent City.</p></li>
<li><p><code>latitude</code>: there is a definite upward trend here, in
that stations further north (higher latitude) are likely to have
a higher rainfall. I’d call this trend linear (or, not obviously
curved), though the two most northerly stations have one higher
and one much lower rainfall than you’d expect.</p></li>
<li><p><code>fromcoast</code>: this is a weak downward trend, though
the trend is spoiled by those three stations about 150 miles
from the coast that have more than 40 inches of rainfall.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Out of those, only <code>latitude</code> seems to have any meaningful
relationship with <code>rainfall</code>.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Fit a regression with <code>rainfall</code> as the response

</ol>

<p>Here, the intercept is 23.8, the slope is <span class="math inline">\(-0.05\)</span> and R-squared is a
dismal 0.04 (4%). This is a way of seeing that this relationship is
really weak, and it doesn’t even have a curve to the trend or anything
that would compensate for this. I looked at the scatterplot again and
saw that if it were not for the point bottom right which is furthest
from the coast and has almost no rainfall, there would be almost no
trend at all. The slope here is not significantly different from zero,
with a P-value of 0.265.</p>

<p>The intercept is 16.5, the slope is 0.002 and the R-squared is 0.09 or
9%, also terrible. The P-value is 0.105, which is not small enough to
be significant.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>Both variables <code>altitude</code> and <code>fromcoast</code> are
significant in this regression, so they have <em>something to add</em> over and above <code>latitude</code> when it comes to
predicting rainfall, even though (and this seems odd) they have no
apparent relationship with <code>rainfall</code> on their own.
Another way to say this is that the three variables work together
as a team to predict rainfall, and together they do much better
than any one of them can do by themselves.<br />
This also goes to show that the scatterplots we began
with don’t get to the heart of multi-variable relationships,
because they are only looking at the variables two at a time.</p>

<p>This calls for <code>anova</code>. Feed this two fitted models,
smaller (fewer explanatory variables) first. The null hypothesis
is that the two models are equally good (so we should go with the
smaller); the alternative is that the larger model is better, so
that the extra complication is worth it:</p>

<p>R-squared has dropped from 0.9186 to 0.9186! That is, taking
out <code>weight</code> has not just had a minimal effect on R-squared;
it’s not changed R-squared at all. This is because <code>weight</code> was

<p>This can be shorter than describing the whole model again, as you do
with the <code>cigs.2</code> version of <code>lm</code>. The syntax is that
you first specify a “base” fitted model object that you’re going to
update. Because the model <code>cigs.1</code> contains all the information
about the kind of model it is, and which data frame the data come
from, R already knows that this is a linear
multiple regression and which <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s it contains. The second thing to describe is the change from
the “base”. In this case, we want to use the same response variable
and all the same explanatory variables that we had before, except for
<code>weight</code>. This is specified by a special kind of model formula
where <code>.</code> means “whatever was there before”: in English,
“same response and same explanatories except take out <code>weight</code>”.</p>

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><code>nicotine</code> was far from being significant in the model
of (c), and yet in the model of
(d), it was <em>strongly</em> significant, and the
R-squared value of (d) was almost as high as that
of (c). What does this say about the importance of
<code>nicotine</code> as an explanatory variable? Explain, as briefly as
you can manage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>What this says is that you <em>cannot</em> say anything about the
“importance” of <code>nicotine</code> without also describing the
context that you’re talking about. <em>By itself</em>,
<code>nicotine</code> is important, but , <code>nicotine</code> is not
important: precisely, it now has nothing to add over and above
the predictive value that <code>tar</code> has. You might guess that
this is because <code>tar</code> and <code>nicotine</code> are
“saying the same thing” in some fashion.
We’ll explore that in a moment.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

Do you see any strong relationships that do
<em>not</em> include <code>co</code>? Does that shed any light on the last
part? Explain briefly (or “at length” if that’s how it comes
out).</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Plot the entire data frame:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb972"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb972-1"><a href="regression.html#cb972-1"></a><span class="kw">plot</span>(cigs)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-677-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>We’re supposed to ignore <code>co</code>, but I comment that strong
relationships between <code>co</code> and <em>both</em> of <code>tar</code> and
<code>nicotine</code> show up here, along with <code>weight</code> being
at most weakly related to anything else.</p>
<p>That leaves the relationship of <code>tar</code> and <code>nicotine</code>
with each other. That also looks like a strong linear trend. When you
have correlations between explanatory variables, it is called
“multicollinearity”.</p>
<p>I mentioned a while back (in class) that having correlated <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s was
trouble. Here is where we find out why. The problem is that when
<code>co</code> is large, <code>nicotine</code> is large, and a large value of
<code>tar</code> will come along with it. So we don’t know whether a large
value of <code>co</code> is caused by a large value of <code>tar</code> or a
large value of <code>nicotine</code>: there is no way to separate out
their effects because in effect they are “glued together”.</p>
<p>You might know of this effect (in an experimental design context) as
“confounding”: the effect of <code>tar</code> on <code>co</code> is
confounded with the effect of <code>nicotine</code> on <code>co</code>, and
you can’t tell which one deserves the credit for predicting <code>co</code>.</p>
<p>If you were able to design an experiment here, you could (in
principle) manufacture a bunch of cigarettes with high tar; some of
them would have high nicotine and some would have low. Likewise for
low tar. Then the
correlation between <code>nicotine</code> and <code>tar</code> would go away,
their effects on <code>co</code> would no longer be confounded, and you
could see unambiguously which one of the variables deserves credit for
predicting <code>co</code>. Or maybe it depends on both, genuinely, but at
least then you’d know.</p>
<p>We, however, have an observational study, so we have to make do with
the data we have. Confounding is one of the risks we take when we work
with observational data.</p>
<p>This was a “base graphics” plot. There is a way of doing a
<code>ggplot</code>-style “pairs plot”, as this is called, thus:</p>

As ever, `install.packages` first, in the likely event that you
don&#39;t have this package installed yet. Once you do, though, I think
this is a nicer way to get a pairs plot.

This plot is a bit more sophisticated: instead of just having the
scatterplots of the pairs of variables in the row and column, it uses
the diagonal to show a &quot;kernel density&quot; (a smoothed-out histogram),
and upper-right it shows the correlation between each pair of
variables. The three correlations between `co`, `tar`
and `nicotine` are clearly the highest.

If you want only some of the columns to appear in your pairs plot,
`select` them first, and then pass that data frame into
`ggpairs`. Here, we found that `weight` was not
correlated with anything much, so we can take it out and then make a
pairs plot of the other variables:


```r
cigs %&gt;% select(-weight) %&gt;% ggpairs()</code></pre>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-679-1.png" width="672"  /></p>

<li>(A one-mark question.) Would you say, on the evidence so
far, that the regression fits well or badly? Explain (very)
briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>R-squared of 0.97 (97%) is very high, so I’d say this
regression fits very well. That’s all.
I said “on the evidence so far” to dissuade you from
overthinking this, or thinking that you needed to produce
some more evidence. That, plus the fact that this was only
one mark.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>It seems reasonable that an older boy should have a
greater oxygen uptake, all else being equal. Is this supported
by your output? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>If an older boy has greater oxygen uptake (the “all else equal” was a hint),
the slope of <code>age</code> should be
positive. It is not: it is <span class="math inline">\(-0.035\)</span>, so it is suggesting
(all else equal) that a greater age goes with a
<em>smaller</em> oxygen uptake.
The reason why this happens (which you didn’t need, but
you can include it if you like) is that <code>age</code> has a
non-small P-value of 0.07, so that the <code>age</code> slope
is not significantly different from zero. With all the
other variables, <code>age</code> has nothing to <em>add</em>
over and above them, and we could therefore remove it.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>It seems reasonable that a boy with larger weight
should have larger lungs and thus a  larger oxygen uptake. Is that what happens
here? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Look at the P-value for <code>weight</code>. This is 0.14,
not small, and so a boy with larger weight does not have
a significantly larger oxygen uptake, all else
equal. (The slope for <code>weight</code> is not
significantly different from zero either.)
I emphasized “statistically significant” to remind you
that this means to do a test and get a P-value.</p>

<p>Only <code>height</code> is significant, so that’s the
only explanatory variable we need to keep. I would

<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>How has R-squared changed between your two

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>R-squared has dropped by a bit, from 97% to 91%. (Make your own
call: pull out the two R-squared numbers, and say a word or two about
how they compare. I don’t much mind what you say:
“R-squared has decreased (noticeably)”, “R-squared has hardly changed”. But say
something.)</p>

<p>The word “test” again implies something that produces a P-value with a
null hypothesis that you might reject. In this case, the test that
compares two models differing by more than one <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> uses

<p>This P-value of 0.123 is not small, so we do not reject the null
hypothesis. There is not a significant difference in fit between the
two models. Therefore, we should go with the smaller model
<code>boys.2</code> because it is simpler.</p>
<p>That drop in R-squared from 97% to 91% was, it turns out, <em>not</em>
significant: the three extra variables
could have produced a change in R-squared like that,
<em>even if they were worthless</em>.
<label for="tufte-mn-73" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-73" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Recall that adding <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s to a regression will always make R-squared go up, even if they are just random noise.</span></p>
<p>If you have learned about “adjusted R-squared”, you might recall
that this is supposed to go down <em>only</em> if the variables you took
out should not have been taken out. But adjusted R-squared goes down
here as well, from 94% to 89% (not quite as much, therefore). What
happens is that adjusted R-squared is rather more relaxed about
keeping variables than the <code>anova</code> <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test is; if we had used
an <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of something like 0.10, the decision between the two
models would have been a lot closer, and this is reflected in the
adjusted R-squared values.</p>

<p>The correlations with <code>age</code> are all on the low side, but all
the other correlations are high, not just between <code>uptake</code> and the
other variables, but between the explanatory variables as well.</p>
<p>Why is this helpful in understanding what’s going on? Well, imagine a
boy with large height (a tall one). The regression <code>boys.2</code>
says that this alone is enough to predict that such a boy’s oxygen
uptake is likely to be large, since the slope is positive. But the
correlations tell you more: a boy with large height is also (somewhat)
likely to be older (have large age), heavier (large weight) and to have
larger <code>chest</code> cavity. So oxygen uptake does depend on those other
variables as well, but once you know <code>height</code> you can make a
good guess at their values; you don’t need to know them.</p>
<p>Further remarks: <code>age</code> has a low correlation with
<code>uptake</code>, so its non-significance earlier appears to be
“real”: it really does have nothing extra to say, because the other
variables have a stronger link with <code>uptake</code> than
<code>age</code>. Height, however, seems to be the best way of relating
oxygen uptake to any of the other variables. I think the suppositions
from earlier about relating oxygen uptake to “bigness”
<label for="tufte-mn-74" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-74" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">This is not, I don’t think, a real word, but I mean size emphasizing how big a boy is generally, rather than how small.</span> in some sense
are actually sound, but age and weight and <code>chest</code> capture
“bigness” worse than height does. Later, when you learn about
Principal Components, you will see that the first principal component,
the one that best captures how the variables vary together, is often
“bigness” in some sense.</p>
<p>Another way to think about these things is via pairwise
scatterplots. The nicest way to produce these is via <code>ggpairs</code>
from package <code>GGally</code>:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.20</span> Facebook friends and grey matter</h2>
<p>Is there a relationship between the number
of Facebook friends a person has, and the density of grey matter in
the areas of the brain associated with social perception and
associative memory? To find out, a 2012 study measured both of these
variables for a sample of 40 students at City University in London
(England). The data are at
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/facebook.txt">link</a>. The grey
matter density is on a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-score standardized scale. The values are
separated by <em>tabs</em>.</p>
<p>The aim of this question is to produce an R Markdown report that
contains your answers to the questions below.</p>
<p>You should aim to make your report flow smoothly, so that it would be
pleasant for a grader to read, and can stand on its own as an analysis
(rather than just being the answer to a question that I set you).
Some suggestions: give your report a title and arrange it into
sections with an Introduction; add a small amount of additional text
here and there explaining what you are doing and why. I don’t expect
you to spend a large amount of time on this, but I <em>do</em> hope
you will make some effort. (My report came out to 4 Word pages.)</p>

<li>Describe what you see on your scatterplot: is there a
trend, and if so, what kind of trend is it? (Don’t get too taken in

<p>Solution</p>
<p>I’d say there seems to be a weak, upward, apparently linear
trend. The points are not especially close to the trend, so I
don’t think there’s any justification for calling this other
than “weak”. (If you think the trend is, let’s say,
“moderate”, you ought to say what makes you think that: for
example, that the people with a lot of Facebook friends also
tend to have a higher grey matter density. I can live with a
reasonably-justified “moderate”.)
The reason I said not to get taken in by the shape of the smooth
trend is that this has a “wiggle” in it: it goes down again
briefly in the middle. But this is likely a quirk of the data,
and the trend, if there is any, seems to be an upward one.</p>

<li>Is the slope of your regression line significantly
different from zero? What does that mean, in the context of the
data?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The P-value of the slope is 0.005, which is less than
0.05. Therefore the slope <em>is</em> significantly different from
zero. That means that the number of Facebook friends really does
depend on the grey matter density, for the whole population of
interest and not just the 40 students observed here (that were a
sample from that population). I don’t mind so much what you
think the population is, but it needs to be clear that the
relationship applies to a population.
Another way to approach this is to say that you would expect
this relationship to show up again in another similar
experiment. That also works, because it gets at the idea of
reproducibility.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Are you surprised by the results of
parts (b) and (d)? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I <em>am</em> surprised, because I thought the trend on the
scatterplot was so weak that there would not be a significant
slope. I guess there was enough of an upward trend to be
significant, and with <span class="math inline">\(n=40\)</span> observations we were able to get a
significant slope out of that scatterplot. With this many
observations, even a weak correlation can be significantly
nonzero.
You can be surprised or not, but you need to have some kind of
consideration of the strength of the trend on the scatterplot as
against the significance of the slope. For example, if you
decided that the trend was “moderate” in strength, you would
be justified in being less surprised than I was.
Here, there is the usual issue that we have proved that the
slope is not zero (that the relationship is not flat), but we
may not have a very clear idea of what the slope actually
<em>is</em>. There are a couple of ways to get a confidence
interval. The obvious one is to use R as a calculator and go up
and down twice its standard error (to get a rough idea):</p>

<p>Feed <code>confint</code> a “fitted model object” and it’ll give you
confidence intervals (by default 95%) for all the parameters in it.</p>
<p>The confidence interval for the slope goes from about 27 to about
138. That is to say, a one-unit increase in grey matter density goes
with an increase in Facebook friends of this much. This is not
especially insightful: it’s bigger than zero (the test was
significant), but other than that, it could be almost
anything. <em>This</em> is where the weakness of the trend comes back to
bite us. With this much scatter in our data, we need a <em>much</em>
larger sample size to estimate accurately how big an effect grey
matter density has.</p>

<p>There is some “magic” here, since the fitted model object is not
actually a data frame, but it works this way.
That looks to me like a completely random scatter of
points. Thus, I am completely happy with the straight-line regression
that we fitted, and I see no need to improve it.</p>
<p>(You should make two points here: one, describe what you see, and two,
what it implies about whether or not your regression is satisfactory.)</p>
<p>Compare that residual plot with this one:</p>

<p>Now, why did I try adding a smooth trend, and why is it not
necessarily a good idea? The idea of a residual plot is that there
should be no trend, and so the smooth trend curve ought to go straight
across. The problem is that it will tend to wiggle, just by chance, as
here: it looks as if it goes up and down before flattening out. But if
you look at the points, <em>they</em> are all over the place, not close
to the smooth trend at all. So the smooth trend is rather
deceiving. Or, to put it another way, to indicate a real problem, the
smooth trend would have to be a <em>lot</em> farther from flat than this
one is. I’d call this one basically flat.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.21</span> Endogenous nitrogen excretion in carp</h2>
<p>A paper in Fisheries Science reported on variables that
affect “endogenous nitrogen excretion” or ENE in carp raised in
Japan. A number of carp were divided into groups based on body weight,
and each group was placed in a different tank. The mean body weight of
the carp placed in each tank was recorded. The carp were then fed a
protein-free diet three times daily for a period of 20 days. At the
end of the experiment, the amount of ENE in each tank was measured, in
milligrams of total fish body weight per day. (Thus it should not
matter that some of the tanks had more fish than others, because the
scaling is done properly.)</p>

<p>R-squared has gone up from 47% to 74%, a substantial

substantial improvement.
<label for="tufte-mn-77" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-77" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Again, not a surprise, given our initial scatterplot.</span></p>
<p>I try to avoid using the word “significant” in this context, since
we haven’t actually done a test of significance.</p>
<p>The reason for the <code>I()</code> is that the up-arrow has a special
meaning in <code>lm</code>, relating to interactions between factors (as
in ANOVA), that we don’t want here. Putting <code>I()</code> around it
means “use as is”, that is, raise bodyweight to power 2, rather than
using the special meaning of the up-arrow in <code>lm</code>.</p>
<p>Because it’s the up-arrow that is the problem, this applies whenever
you’re raising an explanatory variable to a power (or taking a
reciprocal or a square root, say).</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Is the test for the slope coefficient for the squared term
significant? What does this mean?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Look along the <code>bodyweight</code>-squared line to get a P-value
of 0.031. This is less than the default 0.05, so it <em>is</em>
significant.
This means, in short, that the quadratic model is a significant
<em>improvement</em> over the linear one.
<label for="tufte-mn-78" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-78" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Now we can use that word <em>significant</em>.</span>
Said longer: the null hypothesis being tested is that the slope
coefficient of the squared term is zero (that is, that the squared
term has nothing to add over the linear model). This is rejected,
so the squared term has <em>something</em> to add in terms of
quality of prediction.</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Make the scatterplot of part (b), but add
the fitted curve. Describe any way in which the curve fails to fit well.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is a bit slippery, because the points to plot and the
fitted curve are from different data frames. What you do in this
case is to put a <code>data=</code> in one of the <code>geom</code>s,
which says “don’t use the data frame that was in the <code>ggplot</code>, but use this one instead”.
I would think about
starting with the regression object <code>carp.2</code> as my base
data frame, since we want (or I want) to do two things with
that: plot the fitted values and join them with lines. Then I
want to add the original data, just the points:</p>

<p>This works, but is not very aesthetic, because the bodyweight that is
plotted against the fitted values is in the wrong data frame, and so
we have to use the dollar-sign thing to get it from the right one.</p>
<p>A better way around this is “augment” the data with output from the regression object.

<p>so now you see what <code>carp.2a</code> has in it, and then:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1022"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1022-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1022-1"></a>g &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(carp<span class="fl">.2</span>a, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> bodyweight, <span class="dt">y =</span> .fitted)) <span class="op">+</span></span>

<p>This is easier coding: there are only two non-standard things. The
first is that the fitted-value lines should be a distinct colour like
blue so that you can tell them from the data points. The second thing
is that for the second <code>geom_point</code>, the one that plots the data,
the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate <code>bodyweight</code> is correct so that we don’t
have to change that; we only have to change the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinate, which
is <code>ENE</code>. The plot is this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1023"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1023-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1023-1"></a>g</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-702-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Concerning interpretation, you have a number of possibilities
here. The simplest is that the points in the middle are above the
curve, and the points at the ends are below. (That is, negative
residuals at the ends, and positive ones in the middle, which gives
you a hint for the next part.) Another is that the parabola curve
fails to capture the <em>shape</em> of the relationship; for example, I
see nothing much in the data suggesting that the relationship should go
back up, and even given that, the fitted curve doesn’t go especially
near any of the points.</p>
<p>I was thinking that the data should be fit better by something like
the left half of an upward-opening parabola, but I guess the curvature
on the left half of the plot suggests that it needs most of the left
half of the parabola just to cover the left half of the plot.</p>
<p>The moral of the story, as we see in the next part, is that the
parabola is the wrong curve for the job.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Obtain a residual plot for the parabola model. Do you see
any problems with it? (If you do, I’m not asking you to do anything
about them in this question, but I will.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The same idea as before for the other residual plot. Use the
fitted model object <code>carp.2</code> as your data frame for the
<code>ggplot</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1024"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1024-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1024-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(carp<span class="fl">.2</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-703-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I think this is <em>still</em> a curve (or, it goes down and then
sharply up at the end). Either way, there is still a pattern.</p>
<p>That was all I needed, but as to what this means: our parabola was a
curve all right, but it appears not to be the right <em>kind</em> of
curve. I think the original data looks more like a hyperbola (a curve
like <span class="math inline">\(y=1/x\)</span>) than a parabola, in that it seems to decrease fast and
then gradually to a limit, and <em>that</em> suggests, as in the class
example, that we should try an asymptote model. Note how I specify it,
with the <code>I()</code> thing again, since <code>/</code> has a special meaning
to <code>lm</code> in the same way that
<code>^</code> does:</p>

<p>That fits <em>extraordinarily</em> well, with an R-squared up near
98%. The intercept is the asymptote, which suggests a (lower) limit
of about 5.2 for <code>ENE</code> (in the limit for large bodyweight). We
would have to ask the fisheries scientist whether this kind of thing
is a reasonable biological mechanism. It says that a carp always has
some ENE, no matter how big it gets, but a smaller carp will have a
lot more.</p>
<p>Does the fitted value plot look reasonable now? This is <code>augment</code> again since the fitted values and observed data come from different data frames:</p>

<p>I’d say that does a really nice job of fitting the data. But it would
be nice to have a few more tanks with large-bodyweight fish, to
convince us that we have the shape of the trend right.</p>
<p>And, as ever, the residual plot. That’s a lot easier than the plot we

<p>For you, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="sh2.png" /></p>
<p>We don’t know how many rows of data there are yet, so I’ve left a
“placeholder” for it, when we figure it out.
The file is annoyingly called <code>sparrowhawk.txt</code>,
singular. Sorry about that.
If you knit this (click on “Knit HTML” next to the ball of wool,
or press control-shift-K), it should run, and you’ll see a viewer
pop up with the HTML output. Now you can see how many rows there
are, and you can go back and edit the R Markdown and put in 13 in
place of <code>xxx</code>, and knit again.
You might be worried about how hard R is working with all this
knitting. Don’t worry about that. R can take it.
Mine looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="waluj.png" /></p>
<p>There is a better way of adding values that come from the output,
which I mention here in case you are interested (if you are not,
feel free to skip this). What you do is to make what is called an
“inline code chunk”. Where you want a number to appear in the
text, you have some R Markdown that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="sh3.png" /></p>
<p>The piece inside the backticks is the letter <code>r</code>, a space,
and then one line of R code. The one line of code will be run, and
all of the stuff within the backticks will be replaced in the
output by the result of running the R code, in this case the
number 13. Typically, you are extracting a number from the data,
like the number of rows or a mean of something. If it’s a decimal
number, it will come out with a lot of decimal places unless you
explicitly <code>round</code> it.
OK, let me try it: the data frame has 13
rows altogether. I didn’t type that number; it was calculated from
the data frame. Woo hoo!</p>

<pre><code>## [1] -0.7484673</code></pre>
<p>Or you can ask for the correlations of the whole data frame:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1036"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1036-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1036-1"></a><span class="kw">cor</span>(sparrowhawks)</span></code></pre></div>

## returning  1.0000000 -0.7484673
## newadults -0.7484673  1.0000000</code></pre>
<p>This latter is a “correlation matrix” with a correlation between each
column and each other column. Obviously the correlation between a
column and itself is 1, and that is <em>not</em> the one we want.</p>

<p>That checks that we have the right <em>number</em> of observations; to

<p>A person working in any field cannot have a negative number of years
of experience, and cannot have more than about 40 years of experience
(or else they would have retired). Our experience numbers fit
that. Salaries had better be five or six figures, and salaries for
social workers are not generally all that high, so these figures look
reasonable.</p>
<p>A rather more <code>tidyverse</code> way is this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1047"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1047-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1047-1"></a>soc <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>

  </script>
</div>
<p>This gets the minimum and maximum of all the variables. I would have
liked them arranged in a nice rectangle (<code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
as rows, the variables as columns), but that’s not how this came out.</p>
<p>The code so far uses <code>across</code>. This means to do something across multiple columns. In this case, we want to do the calculation on <em>all</em> the columns, so we use the select-helper <code>everything</code>. You can use any of the other select-helpers like <code>starts_with</code>, or you could do something like <code>where(is.numeric)</code> to do your summaries only on the quantitative columns (which would also work here). The dots inside <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> mean “the variable we are looking at at the moment”, and the squiggles before <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> mean “calculate”, so you read the above code as “for each column, work out the smallest and largest value of it”.</p>
<p>What, you want a nice rectangle? This is a pivot-longer, but the fancy version because the column names encode two kinds of things, a variable and a statistic:</p>

<p>Note the strategy: make it longer first, then figure out what to do next. This is different from <code>rowwise</code>; in fact, we are working “columnwise”, doing something for each column, no matter how many there are. My go-to for this stuff is <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another way to work is with the five-number summary. This gives a more nuanced picture of the data values we have.
<label for="tufte-mn-80" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-80" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">This might be overkill at this point, since we really only care about whether our data values are reasonable, and often just looking at the highest and lowest values will tell us that.</span></p>
<p>The base-R five-number summary looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1050"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1050-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1050-1"></a>qq &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">quantile</span>(soc<span class="op">$</span>experience)</span>
<span id="cb1050-2"><a href="regression.html#cb1050-2"></a>qq</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##    0%   25%   50%   75%  100% 
##  1.00 13.50 20.00 24.75 28.00</code></pre>
<p>This is what’s known as a “named vector”. The numbers on the bottom are the summaries themselves, and the names above say which percentile you are looking at. Unfortunately, the <code>tidyverse</code> doesn’t like names, so modelling after the above doesn’t quite work:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1052"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1052-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1052-1"></a>soc <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>

<p>The slope is (significantly) positive, which squares with our guess
(more experience goes with greater salary), and also the upward trend
on the scatterplot. The value of the slope is about 2,000; this means
that one more year of experience goes with about a $2,000 increase in
salary.</p>

<li>Obtain and plot the residuals against the fitted values. What
problem do you see?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this with <code>ggplot</code> is to plot the
<em>regression object</em> (even though it is not actually a data
frame), and plot the <code>.fitted</code> and <code>.resid</code>
columns in it, not forgetting the initial dots:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1057"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1057-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1057-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(soc<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-722-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I see a “fanning-out”: the residuals are getting bigger <em>in size</em>
(further away from zero) as the fitted values get bigger. That
is, when the (estimated) salary gets larger, it also gets more
variable.</p>
<p>Fanning-out is sometimes hard to see. What you can do if you suspect
that it might have happened is to plot the <em>absolute value</em> of
the residuals against the fitted values. The absolute value is the
residual without its plus or minus sign, so if the residuals are
getting bigger in size, their absolute values are getting bigger. That
would look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1058"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1058-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1058-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(soc<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="kw">abs</span>(.resid))) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-723-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I added a smooth trend to this to help us judge whether the
absolute-value-residuals are getting bigger as the fitted values get
bigger. It looks to me as if the overall trend is an increasing one,
apart from those few small fitted values that have larger-sized
residuals. Don’t get thrown off by the kinks in the smooth trend. Here
is a smoother version:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1060"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1060-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1060-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(soc<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="kw">abs</span>(.resid))) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>(<span class="dt">span =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-724-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The larger fitted values, according to this, have residuals larger in size.</p>
<p>The thing that controls the smoothness of the smooth trend is the
value of <code>span</code> in <code>geom_smooth</code>. The default is
0.75. The larger the value you use, the smoother the trend; the
smaller, the more wiggly. I’m inclined to think that the default value
is a bit too small. Possibly this value is too big, but it shows you
the idea.</p>

<li>The problem you unearthed in the previous part is often helped
by a transformation. Run Box-Cox on your data to find a suitable
transformation. What transformation is suggested?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>You’ll need to call in (and install if necessary) the package
<code>MASS</code> that contains <code>boxcox</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1062"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1062-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1062-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(MASS)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I explain that “masked” thing below.</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-726-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>That one looks like <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=0\)</span> or log. You could probably also
justify fourth root (power 0.25), but log is a very common
transformation, which people won’t need much persuasion to accept.</p>
<p>There’s one annoyance with <code>MASS</code>: it has a <code>select</code>
(which I have never used), and if you load <code>tidyverse</code> first
and <code>MASS</code> second, as I have done here, when you mean to run
the column-selection <code>select</code>, it will actually run the
<code>select</code> that comes from <code>MASS</code>, and give you an error
that you will have a terrible time debugging. That’s what that
“masked” message was when you loaded <code>MASS</code>.</p>
<p>So I’m going to be tidy and get rid of <code>MASS</code>, now that I’m
finished with it. Let’s first see which packages are loaded, rather a
lot in my case:

<p>It has. Now any calls to <code>select</code> will use the right one. We hope.</p>
<p>The output of <code>search</code> is called the <strong>search list</strong>, and
it tells you where R will go looking for things. The first one
<code>.GlobalEnv</code> is where all
<label for="tufte-mn-82" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-82" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">All the ones that are part of this project, anyway.</span>
your
variables, data frames etc. get stored, and that is what gets
searched first.
<label for="tufte-mn-83" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-83" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">That means that if you write a function with the same name as one that is built into R or a package, yours is the one that will get called. This is probably a bad idea, since you won’t be able to get at R’s function by that name.</span>
Then R will go
looking in each thing in turn until it finds what it is looking
for. When you load a package with <code>library()</code>, it gets added to
the list <em>in second place</em>, behind <code>.GlobalEnv</code>. So, when
we had <code>MASS</code> loaded (the first <code>search()</code>), if we
called <code>select</code>, then it would find the one in <code>MASS</code>
first.</p>
<p>If you want to insist on something like “the <code>select</code> that lives in <code>dplyr</code>”,
you can do that by saying
<code>dplyr::select</code>. But this is kind of cumbersome if you don’t
need to do it, which is why I got rid of <code>MASS</code> here.</p>

<p>The second line is where the fun starts: <code>lm</code> wants the data
frame as a <code>data=</code> at the end. So, to specify a data frame in
something like <code>lm</code>, we have to use the special symbol
<code>.</code>, which is another way to say
“the data frame that came out of the previous step”.</p>
<p>Got that? All right. The last line is a piece of cake in
comparison. Normally <code>summary</code> would require a data frame or a
fitted model object, but the second line produces one (a fitted model
object) as output, which goes into <code>summary</code> as the first
(and only) thing, so all is good and we get the regression output.</p>
<p>What we lose by doing this is that if we need something later from this
fitted model object, we are out of luck since we didn’t save
it. That’s why I created <code>soc.2</code> and <code>soc.3</code> above.</p>
<p>You can also put functions of things directly into <code>lm</code>:</p>

<p>That, to my mind, is a horizontal band of points, so I would say yes,
I have solved the fanning out.</p>
<p>One concern I have about the residuals is that there seem to be a
couple of very negative values: that is, are the residuals normally
distributed as they should be? Well, that’s easy enough to check:</p>

<p>The issues here are that those bottom two values are a bit too low,
and the top few values are a bit bunched up (that curve at the top).
It is really not bad, though, so I am making the call that I don’t
think I needed to worry.
Note that the transformation we found here is the same as the
log-salary used by the management consultants in the

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.24</span> Predicting volume of wood in pine trees</h2>
<p>In forestry, the financial value of a tree
is the volume of wood that it contains. This is difficult to estimate
while the tree is still standing, but the diameter is easy to measure
with a tape measure (to measure the circumference) and a calculation
involving <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, assuming that the cross-section of the tree is at
least approximately circular. The standard measurement is
“diameter at breast height”
(that is, at the height of a human breast or
chest), defined as being 4.5 feet above the ground.</p>
<p>Several pine trees had their diameter measured shortly before being
cut down, and for each tree, the volume of wood was recorded. The data
are in
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/pinetrees.txt">link</a>. The
diameter is in inches and the volume is in cubic inches. Is it
possible to predict the volume of wood from the diameter?</p>

<p>The word “relationship” offers a clue that a scatterplot would
have been a good idea, if you hadn’t realized by now.
I am guided by “form, direction, strength” in looking at a scatterplot:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Form: it is an apparently linear relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Direction: it is an upward trend: that is, a tree with a larger diameter also has a larger volume of wood. (This is not very surprising.)</p></li>
<li><p>Strength: I’d call this a strong (or moderate-to-strong) relationship. (We’ll see in a minute what the R-squared is.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to be as formal as this, but you <em>do</em> need
to get at the idea that it is an upward trend, apparently
linear, and at least fairly strong.

therefore that the regression is fine. Or you could say that there is
fanning-in: the two points on the right have residuals close to 0
while the points on the left have residuals larger in size. Say
something.</p>
<p>I don’t think you can justify a curve or a trend, because
the residuals on the left are both positive and negative.</p>
<p>My feeling is that the residuals on the right are close to 0 because
these points have noticeably larger diameter than the others, and they
are <em>influential</em> points in the regression that will pull the
line closer to themselves. This is why their residuals are close to
zero. But I am happy with either of the points made in the paragraph

<li>What would you guess would be the volume of a tree of
diameter zero? Is that what the regression predicts? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Logically, a tree that has diameter zero is a non-existent tree,
so its volume should be zero as well.
In the regression, the quantity that says what volume is when
diameter is zero is the <em>intercept</em>. Here the intercept is
<span class="math inline">\(-192\)</span>, which is definitely not zero. In fact, if you look at
the P-value, the intercept is significantly <em>less</em> than
zero. Thus, the model makes no logical sense for trees of small
diameter. The smallest tree in the data set has diameter 18,
which is not really small, I suppose, but it is a little
disconcerting to have a model that makes no logical sense.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>According to
<a href="http://www.web-formulas.com/Math_Formulas/Geometry_Volume_of_Cone.aspx">link</a>,
the volume of a cone is <span class="math inline">\(V=\pi r^2h/3\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the volume,
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the radius (at the bottom of the cone) and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is the
height. The diameter is twice the radius, so replace <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> by
<span class="math inline">\(d/2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> being the diameter. A little algebra gives

<p>This adds an intercept as well, which is fine (there are technical
difficulties around removing the intercept).</p>
<p>That’s as far as I wanted you to go, but (of course) I have a few
comments.</p>
<p>The intercept here is still negative, but not significantly different
from zero, which is a step forward. The R-squared for this regression
is very similar to that from our linear model (the one for which the
intercept made no sense). So, from that point of view, either model
predicts the data well. I should look at the residuals from this one:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1095"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1095-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1095-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(volume<span class="fl">.2</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-746-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I really don’t think there are any problems there.</p>
<p>Now, I said to assume that the trees are all of similar height. This
seems entirely questionable, since the trees vary quite a bit in
diameter, and you would guess that trees with bigger diameter would
also be taller. It seems more plausible that the same kind of trees
(pine trees in this case) would have the same “shape”, so that if
you knew the diameter you could <em>predict</em> the height, with
larger-diameter trees being taller. Except that we don’t have the
heights here, so we can’t build a model for that.</p>
<p>So I went looking in the literature. I found this paper:
<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5497/3d02d63428e3dfed6645acfdba874ad80822.pdf">link</a>. This
gives several models for relationships between volume, diameter and height. In
the formulas below, there is an implied “plus error” on the right,
and the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> are parameters to be estimated.</p>
<p>For predicting height from diameter (equation 1 in paper):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[  h = \exp(\alpha_1+\alpha_2 d^{\alpha_3}) \]</span></p>
<p>For predicting volume from height and diameter (equation 6):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[  V = \alpha_1 d^{\alpha_2} h^{\alpha_3} \]</span></p>
<p>This is a take-off on our assumption that the trees were cone-shaped,
with cone-shaped trees having <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1=\pi/12\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2=2\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_3=1\)</span>. The paper uses different units, so <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span> is not
comparable, but <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_3\)</span> are (as estimated from the
data in the paper, which were for longleaf pine) quite close to 2 and
1.</p>
<p>Last, the actual relationship that helps us: predicting volume from
just diameter (equation 5):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[  V = \alpha_1 d^{\alpha_2}\]</span></p>
<p>This is a power law type of relationship. For example, if you were
willing to pretend that a tree was a cone with height proportional to
diameter (one way of getting at the idea of a bigger tree typically
being taller, instead of assuming constant height as we did), that
would imply <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2=3\)</span> here.</p>
<p>This is non-linear as it stands, but we can bash it into shape by taking
logs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\ln V = \ln \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \ln d
\]</span></p>
<p>so that log-volume has a linear relationship with log-diameter and we
can go ahead and estimate it:</p>

<p>The parameter that I called <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2\)</span> above is the slope of this
model, 3.13. This is a bit different from the figure in the paper,
which was 2.19. I think these are comparable even though the other
parameter is not (again, measurements in different units, plus, this
time we need to take the log of it). I think the “slopes” are
comparable because we haven’t estimated our slope all that accurately:</p>

<p>From 2.3 to 3.9. It is definitely not zero, but we are rather less
sure about what it is, and 2.19 is not completely implausible.</p>
<p>The R-squared here, though it is less than the other ones we
got, is still high. The residuals are these:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1100"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1100-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1100-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(volume<span class="fl">.3</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-749-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>which again seem to show no problems. The residuals are smaller in
size now because of the log transformation: the actual and predicted
log-volumes are smaller numbers than the actual and predicted volumes,
so the residuals are now closer to zero.</p>
<p>Does this model behave itself at zero? Well, roughly at least: if the
diameter is very small, its log is very negative, and the predicted
log-volume is also very negative (the slope is positive). So the
predicted actual volume will be close to zero. If you want to make
that mathematically rigorous, you can take limits, but that’s the
intuition. We can also do some predictions: set up a data frame that has a column called <code>diameter</code> with some diameters to predict for:</p>

<p>I almost got caught by forgetting the <code>list</code> on the definition of <code>glances</code>. I certainly need it, because the output from <code>glance</code> is a (one-row) dataframe, not a single number.</p>
<p>It works. You see the three R-squared values in the first column of numbers. The
third model is otherwise a lot different from the others because it
has a different response variable.</p>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>
<p>How might you measure or estimate the height of a
tree (other than by climbing it and dropping a tape measure down)? One
way, that works if the tree is fairly isolated, is to walk away from
its base. Periodically, you point at the top of the tree, and when the
angle between your arm and the ground reaches 45 degrees, you stop
walking. (If it’s greater than 45 degrees, you walk further away, and
if it’s less, you walk back towards the tree.) The distance between
you and the base of the tree is then equal to the height of the tree,
and if you have a long enough tape measure you can measure it.</p>
<p>The above works because the tangent of 45 degrees is 1. If you have a
device that will measure the actual angle,

I found one called Clinometer. See also <a href="https://gabrielhemery.com/how-to-calculate-tree-height-using-a-smartphone/">link</a>.</span>
you
can be any distance away from the tree, point the device at the top,
record the angle, and do some trigonometry to estimate the height of
the tree (to which you add the height of your eyes).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.25</span> Tortoise shells and eggs</h2>

<li>Is a curve better than a line for these data? Justify your
answer in two ways: by comparing a measure of fit, and by doing a
suitable test of significance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>An appropriate measure of fit is R-squared. For the straight line,
this is about 0.01, and for the regression with the squared term it
is about 0.43. This tells us that a straight line fits appallingly
badly, and that a curve fits a <em>lot</em> better.
This doesn’t do a test, though. For that, look at the slope of the
length-squared term in the second regression; in particular,
look at its P-value. This is 0.0045, which is small: the squared
term is necessary, and taking it out would be a mistake. The
relationship really is curved, and trying to describe it with a
straight line would be a big mistake.</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Make a residual plot for the straight line model: that is, plot
the residuals against the fitted values.
Does this echo
your conclusions of the previous part? In what way? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Plot the things called <code>.fitted</code> and <code>.resid</code> from the
regression object, which is not a data frame but you can treat it as
if it is for this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1117"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1117-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1117-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(tortoises<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-760-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Looking at the plot, you see a curve, up and down. The most
negative residuals go with small or large fitted values; when the
fitted value is in the middle, the residual is usually positive. A
curve on the residual plot indicates a curve in the actual
relationship. We just found above that a curve does fit a lot
better, so this is all consistent.</p>
<p>Aside: the grey “envelope” is wide, so there is a lot of scatter on the
residual plot. The grey envelope almost contains zero all the way
across, so the evidence for a curve (or any other kind of trend) is
not all that strong, based on this plot. This is in great contrast to
the regression with length-squared, where the length-squared term is
<em>definitely</em> necessary.</p>
<p>That was all I wanted, but you can certainly look at other
plots. Normal quantile plot of the residuals:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-761-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This is not the best: the low values are a bit too low, so that the
whole picture is (a little) skewed to the left.

<p>I put the smooth curve on as a kind of warning: it looks as if the
size of the residuals goes down and then up again as the fitted values
increase. But the width of the grey “envelope” and the general
scatter of the points suggests that there is really not much happening
here at all. On a plot of residuals, the grey envelope is really more
informative than the blue smooth trend. On this one, there is no
evidence of any fan-out (or fan-in).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.26</span> Crickets revisited</h2>
<p>This is a continuation of the crickets problem that you
may have seen before (minus the data tidying).</p>
<p>Male tree crickets produce “mating songs” by rubbing their wings
together to produce a chirping sound. It is hypothesized that female
tree crickets identify males of the correct species by how fast (in
chirps per second) the male’s mating song is. This is called the
“pulse rate”. Some data for two species of crickets are in
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/crickets2.csv">link</a> as a CSV
file. The columns are species (text), temperature, and pulse
rate (numbers). This is the tidied version of the data set that the
previous version of this question had you create.
The research question is whether males
of the different species have different average pulse rates. It is
also of interest to see whether temperature has an effect, and if
so, what.</p>

would you describe differences in pulse rates between species now?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The plot tells you that (for both species) as temperature goes
up, pulse rate goes up as well. <em>Allowing for that</em>, the
difference in pulse rates between the two species is even
clearer than it was before. To see an example, pick a
temperature, and note that the mean pulse rate at that
temperature seems to be at least 10 higher for
<em>exclamationis</em>, with a high degree of consistency.
The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test mixed up all the pulse rates at all the different
temperatures. Even though the conclusion was clear enough, it
could be clearer if we incorporated temperature into the analysis.
There was also a potential source of unfairness in that the
<em>exclamationis</em> crickets tended to be observed at higher
temperatures than <em>niveus</em> crickets; since pulse rates
increase with temperature, the apparent difference in pulse
rates between the species might have been explainable by one
species being observed mainly in higher temperatures. This was
<em>utterly invisible</em> to us when we did the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, but it
shows the importance of accounting for all the relevant
variables when you do your analysis.

<p>The P-value for species is now <span class="math inline">\(6.27\times 10^{-14}\)</span> or
0.00000000000006, which is even less than the P-value of 0.00001 that
came out of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. That is to say, when you know temperature,
you can be even more sure of your conclusion that there is a
difference between the species.</p>
<p>The R-squared for this regression is almost 99%, which says that if
you know both temperature and species, you can predict the pulse rate
almost exactly.</p>
<p>In the regression output, the slope for species is about <span class="math inline">\(-10\)</span>. It is
labelled <code>speciesniveus</code>. Since species is categorical,
<code>lm</code> uses the first category, <em>exclamationis</em>, as the
baseline and expresses each other species relative to that. Since the
slope is about <span class="math inline">\(-10\)</span>, it says that at any given temperature, the mean
pulse rate for <em>niveus</em> is about 10 less than for
<em>exclamationis</em>. This is pretty much what the scatterplot told
us.</p>
<p>We can go a little further here:</p>

<p>The second line says that the pulse rate for <em>niveus</em> is
between about 8.5 and 11.5 less than for <em>exclamationis</em>, at
any given temperature (comparing the two species at the same
temperature as each other, but that temperature could be
anything). This is a lot shorter than the CI that came out of the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, that went from 14 to 32. This is because we are now
accounting for temperature, which also makes a difference. (In the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, the temperatures were all mixed up). What we also see is
that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-interval is shifted up compared to the one from the
regression. This is because the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-interval conflates

two things: the <em>exclamationis</em> crickets do have a
higher pulse rate, but they were also observed at higher temperatures,
which makes it look as if their pulse rates are more
higher

<p>This particular model constrains the slope with temperature to be the
same for both species (just the intercepts differ). If you want to
allow the slopes to differ between species, you add an interaction
between temperature and species:</p>

<p>There’s no significant improvement by adding the interaction, so
there’s no evidence that having different slopes for each species is
necessary. This is the same interpretation as any <code>anova</code> for
comparing two regressions: the two models are not significantly
different in fit, so go with the simpler one, that is, the one without
the interaction.</p>
<p>Note that <code>anova</code> gave the same P-value as did the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test for the slope coefficient for the interaction in
<code>summary</code>, 0.254 in both cases. This is because there were only
two species and therefore only one slope coefficient was required to
distinguish them. If there had been three species, we would have had
to look at the <code>anova</code> output to hunt for a difference among
species, since there would have been two slope coefficients, each with
its own P-value.

<p>If you haven’t seen interactions before, don’t worry about this. The
idea behind it is that we are testing whether we needed lines with
different slopes and we concluded that we don’t. Don’t worry so much
about the mechanism behind <code>pulse.2</code>; just worry about how it
somehow provides a way of modelling two different slopes, one for each
species, which we can then test to see whether it helps.</p>
<p>The upshot is that we do not need different slopes; the model
<code>pulse.1</code> with the same slope for each species describes what

<li>Make suitable residual plots for the regression

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>First, the plot of residuals against fitted values (after all,
it <em>is</em> a regression):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1143"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1143-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1143-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(pulse<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-774-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This looks nice and random.</p>
<p>Now, we plot the residuals against the explanatory variables. There
are two, temperature and species, but the latter is categorical. We’ll
have some extra issues around species, but before we get to that, we
have to remember that the data and the output from the regression are
in different places when we plot them. There are different ways to get
around that. Perhaps the simplest is to use <code>pulse.1</code> as our
“default” data frame and then get <code>temperature</code> from the
right place:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1144"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1144-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1144-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(pulse<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> crickets<span class="op">$</span>temperature, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-775-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I don’t see anything untoward there.</p>
<p>Species. We want to compare the residuals for the two species, which
is categorical. Since the residuals are quantitative, this suggests a
boxplot. Remembering to get species from the right place again, that
goes like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1145"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1145-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1145-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(pulse<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> crickets<span class="op">$</span>species, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-776-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>For the residuals, the median should be zero within each group, and
the two groups should be approximately normal with mean 0 and about
the same spread. Same spread looks OK, since the boxes are almost
exactly the same height, but the normality is not quite there, since
both distributions are a little bit skewed to the right. That would
also explain why the median residual in each group is a little bit
less than zero, because the mathematics requires the overall
<em>mean</em> residual to be zero, and the right-skewness would make the
mean higher than the median.</p>
<p>Is that non-normality really problematic? Well, I could look at the
normal quantile plot of all the residuals together:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1146"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1146-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1146-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(pulse<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-777-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>There’s a little weirdness at the top, and a tiny indication of a
curve (that would suggest a little right-skewedness), but not really
much to worry about. If that third-highest residual were a bit
lower (say, 3 rather than 3.5) and maybe if the lowest residual was a
bit lower, I don’t think we’d have anything to complain about at all.</p>
<p>So, I’m not worried.</p>

<p>The number of marks for this kind of thing has been decreasing through
the course, since by now you ought to have figured out how to do it
without looking it up.</p>
<p>There are 10 rows for the promised 10 roller-coasters, and there are
several columns: the drop for each roller-coaster and the duration of
its ride, as promised, as well as the name of each roller-coaster and the state
that it is in. (A lot of them seem to be in Ohio, for some reason that
I don’t know.) So this all looks good.</p>

<p>The last part, about the labels not overlapping, is an
invitation to use <code>ggrepel</code>, which is the way I’d

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Would you say that roller-coasters with a larger drop tend

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I think there are two good answers here: “yes” and “kind of”.
Supporting “yes” is the fact that the regression line does go
uphill, so that overall, or on average, roller-coasters with a
larger drop do tend to have a longer duration of ride as well.
Supporting “kind of” is the fact that, though the regression
line goes uphill, there are a lot of roller-coasters that are
some way off the trend, far from the regression line.
I am happy to go with either of those. I could also go with
“not really” and the same discussion that I attached to
“kind of”.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Find a roller-coaster that is unusual compared to the

<code>duration</code> is unusual?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is an invitation to find a point that is a long way off the
line. I think the obvious choice is my first one below, but I
would take either of the others as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Nitro” is a long way above the line. That means it has
a long duration, relative to its drop. There are two other
roller-coasters that have a larger drop but not as long a
duration. In other words, this roller-coaster drops slowly,
presumably by doing a lot of twisting, loop-the-loop and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Beast” is a long way below the line, so it has a
short duration relative to its drop. It is actually the
shortest ride of all, but is only a bit below average in terms
of drop. This suggests that The Beast is one of those rides
that drops a long way quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>“Millennium Force” has the biggest drop of all, but a
shorter-than-average duration. This looks like another ride
with a big drop in it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A roller-coaster that is “unusual” will have a residual that
is large in size (either positive, like Nitro, or negative, like
the other two). I didn’t ask you to find the residuals, but if
you want to, <code>augment</code> from <code>broom</code> is the
smoothest way to go:</p>

<p><code>augment</code> produces a data frame (of the original data frame
with some new columns that come from the regression), so I can feed it
into a pipe to do things with it, like only displaying the columns I
want, and arranging them in order by absolute value of residual, so
that the roller-coasters further from the line come out first. This
identifies the three that we found above. The fourth one, “Ghost Rider”,
is like Nitro in that it takes a (relatively) long time to
fall not very far.
You can also put <code>augment</code> in the <em>middle</em> of a pipe. What
you may have to do then is supply the <em>original</em> data frame name
to <code>augment</code> so that you have everything:</p>

<p>I wanted to hang on to the roller-coaster names, so I added the data
frame name to <code>augment</code>. If you don’t (that is, you just put
<code>augment()</code> in the middle of a pipe), then <code>augment</code>
“attempts to reconstruct the data from the model”.
<label for="tufte-mn-99" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-99" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">A quote from the package vignette.</span> That means you wouldn’t get
<em>everything</em> from the original data frame; you would just get the
things that were in the regression. In this case, that means you would lose
the coaster names.</p>
<p>A technicality (but one that you should probably care about):
<code>augment</code> takes up to <em>two</em> inputs: a fitted model object
like my <code>duration.1</code>, and an optional data frame to include
other things from, like the coaster names. I had only one input to it
in the pipe because the implied first input was the output from the
<code>lm</code>, which doesn’t have a name; the input <code>coasters</code> in
the pipe was what would normally be the <em>second</em> input to
<code>augment</code>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.28</span> Running and blood sugar</h2>
<p>A diabetic wants to know how aerobic exercise affects his
blood sugar. When his blood sugar reaches 170 (mg/dl), he goes out for
a run at a pace of 10 minutes per mile. He runs different distances on
different days. Each time he runs, he measures his blood sugar after
the run. (The preferred blood sugar level is between 80 and 120 on
this scale.) The data are in the file

<p><code>blood_sugar</code> should be on the vertical axis, since this is
what we are trying to predict. Getting the <code>x</code> and the

<p>Solution</p>
<p>I’d say that this is about as linear as you could ever wish
for. Neither the pattern of points nor the smooth trend have any
kind of noticeable bend in them. (Observing a lack of curvature in
either the points or the smooth trend is enough.) The trend
is a linear one, so using a regression will be just fine. (If it

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>How would you <em>interpret</em> the slope? That is, what is
the slope, and what does that mean about blood sugar and running distance?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The slope is <span class="math inline">\(-25.37\)</span>. This means that for each additional mile run,
the runner’s blood sugar will decrease on average by about 25 units.</p>
<p>You can check this from the scatterplot. For example, from 2 to 3
miles, average blood sugar decreases from about 140 to about 115, a
drop of 25.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Is there a (statistically) significant relationship between
running distance and blood sugar? How do you know? Do you find this
surprising, given what you have seen so far? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Look at the P-value either on the <code>distance</code> line (for its
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test) or for the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic on the bottom line. These are
the same: 0.000000023. (They will be the same any time there is
one <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variable.) This P-value is <em>way</em> smaller than 0.05,
so there <em>is</em> a significant relationship between running distance
and blood sugar. This does not surprise me in the slightest,
because the trend on the scatterplot is <em>so</em> clear, there’s
no way it could have happened by chance if in fact there were no
relationship between running distance and blood sugar.</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>This diabetic is planning to go for a 3-mile run tomorrow
and a 5-mile run the day after. Obtain suitable 95% intervals that
say what his blood sugar might be after each of these runs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is a prediction interval, in each case, since we are talking about
<em>individual</em> runs of 3 miles and 5 miles (not the mean blood
sugar after <em>all</em> runs of 3 miles, which is what a confidence
interval for the mean response would be).
The procedure is to set up a data frame with the two
<code>distance</code> values in it, and then feed that and the
regression object into <code>predict</code>, coming up in a moment.</p>

<p>Extra: both <code>cbind</code> and <code>data.frame</code> are “base R” ways of
combining a data frame with something else to make a new data
frame. They are not from the <code>tidyverse</code>. The
<code>tidyverse</code> way is via <code>tibble</code> or <code>bind_cols</code>,
but they are a bit more particular about what they will take:
<code>tibble</code> takes vectors (single variables) and
<code>bind_cols</code> takes vectors or data frames. The problem here is
that <code>pp</code> is not either of those:</p>

<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Which of your two intervals is longer? Does this make
sense? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The intervals are about 22.25 and 25.5 units long. The one for a
5-mile run is a bit longer. I think this makes sense because 3
miles is close to the average run distance, so there is a lot of
“nearby” data. 5 miles is actually longer than any of the runs
that were actually done (and therefore we are actually
extrapolating), but the important point for the prediction
interval is that there is less nearby data: those 2-mile runs
don’t help so much in predicting blood sugar after a 5-mile
run. (They help <em>some</em>, because the trend is so linear. This
is why the 5-mile interval is not <em>so</em> much longer. If the
trend were less clear, the 5-mile interval would be more
noticeably worse.)</p>

<p>The file at
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/Pizza.csv">link</a>
came from a spreadsheet of information about 24 brands
of pizza: specifically, per 5-ounce serving, the number of calories,
the grams of fat, and the cost (in US dollars). The names of the pizza
brands are quite long. This file may open in a spreadsheet when you
browse to the link, depending on your computer’s setup.</p>

<p>The four variables are: the brand of pizza, which got read in as text,
the number of calories (an integer), and the fat and cost, which are
both decimal numbers so they get labelled <code>dbl</code>, which is short for
“double-precision floating point number”.</p>

all over the place in a seemingly random pattern (the grey envelope is

<p>For the pizza with 12 grams of fat, the predicted calories are between
261 and 370 with 95% confidence, and for the pizza with 20 grams of
fat, the calories are predicted to be between 337 and 454. (You should
write down what these intervals are, and not leave the reader to find
them in the output.)</p>
<p>(Remember the steps: create a new data frame containing the values to
predict for, and then feed that into <code>predict</code> along with the
model that you want to use to predict with. The variable in the data
frame has to be called <em>precisely</em> <code>Fat</code> with a capital F,
otherwise it won’t work.)</p>
<p>These intervals are both pretty awful: you get a very weak picture of
how many calories per serving the pizza brands in question might
contain. This is for two reasons: (i) there was a fair bit of scatter
in the original relationship, R-squared being around 65%, and (ii)
even if we knew perfectly where the line went (which we don’t),
there’s no guarantee that individual brands of pizza would be on it
anyway. (Prediction intervals are always hit by this double whammy, in
that individual observations suffer from variability in where the line
goes <em>and</em> variability around whatever the line is.)</p>
<p>I was expecting, when I put together this question, that the
20-grams-of-fat interval would be noticeably worse, because 20 is
farther away from the mean fat content of all the brands. But there
isn’t much to choose. For the confidence intervals for the mean
calories of <em>all</em> brands with these fat contents, the picture is clearer:</p>

would guess.</p>
<p>This question is a fair bit of work for 3 points, so I’m not insisting that you explain
your choice of a prediction interval over a confidence interval, but I
think it is still a smart thing to do, even purely from a marks point
of view, because if you get it wrong for a semi-plausible reason, you
might pick up some partial credit. Not pulling out your prediction
intervals from your output is a sure way to lose a point, however.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.30</span> Where should the fire stations be?</h2>
<p>In city planning, one major issue is where to locate fire
stations. If a city has too many fire stations, it will spend too much
on running them, but if it has too few, there may be unnecessary fire
damage because the fire trucks take too long to get to the fire.</p>
<p>The first part of a study of this kind of issue is to understand the
relationship between the distance from the fire station (measured in
miles in our data set) and the amount of fire damage caused (measured
in thousands of dollars). A city recorded the fire damage and distance
from fire station for 15 residential fires (which you can take as a
sample of “all possible residential fires in that city”). The data
are in <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/fire_damage.txt">link</a>.</p>

<p>We need to display the results, since we need to see the R-squared in

<p>R-squared is about 92%, high, indicating a strong and linear
relationship. Back in part~(<a href="#part:howgood">here</a>), I said that the
relationship is linear and strong, which is entirely consistent with
such an R-squared. (If you said something different previously, say
how it does or doesn’t square with this kind of R-squared value.)</p>
<p>Points: one for fitting the regression, one for displaying it, and two
(at the grader’s discretion) for saying what the R-squared is and how
it’s consistent (or not) with part~(<a href="#part:howgood">here</a>).</p>
<p>Extra: if you thought the trend was “definitely curved”, you would

<p>The cubic, in red, does bend a little, but it doesn’t do an obvious
job of going through the points better than the straight line does. It
seems to be mostly swayed by that one observation with damage over 40,
and choosing a relationship by how well it fits one point is flimsy at
the best of times. So, by Occam’s Razor, we go with the line rather
than the cubic because it (i) fits equally well, (ii) is simpler.</p>

<p>I printed them out like this since these give the centres of the
intervals as well as the lower and upper limits.</p>
<p>The centre of the interval is higher for the mean damage when the
distance is 4. This is because the mean distance is a bit less than 4:</p>

  </script>
</div>
<p>We know it’s an upward trend, so our best guess at the mean damage is
higher if the mean distance is higher (in (<a href="#part:cim">here</a>), the
distance is <em>always</em> 4: we’re looking at the mean fire damage for
<em>all</em> residences that are 4 miles from a fire station.)</p>
<p>What about the lengths of the intervals? The one in (<a href="#part:ttest">here</a>)
is about <span class="math inline">\(30.9-21.9=9\)</span> (thousand dollars) long, but the one in
(<a href="#part:cim">here</a>) is only <span class="math inline">\(31.4-28.5=2.9\)</span> long, much shorter. This
makes sense because the relationship is a strong one: knowing the
distance from the fire station is very useful, because the bigger it
is, the bigger the damage going to be, with near certainty. Said
differently, if you know the distance, you can estimate the damage
accurately. If you don’t know the distance (as is the case in
(<a href="#part:ttest">here</a>)), you’re averaging over a lot of different
distances and thus there is a lot of uncertainty in the amount of fire
damage also.</p>
<p>If you have some reasonable discussion of the reason why the centres
and lengths of the intervals differ, I’m happy. It doesn’t have to be
the same as mine.</p>
<p>These problems are about multiple regression (more than one <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variable):</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.31</span> Being satisfied with hospital</h2>
<p>A hospital administrator collects data to study the
effect, if any, of a patient’s age, the severity of their
illness, and their anxiety level, on the patient’s satisfaction with
their hospital experience. The data, in the file
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/satisfaction.txt">link</a>, are
for 46 patients in a survey. The columns are: patient’s satisfaction
score <code>satis</code>, on a scale of 0 to 100; the patient’s <code>age</code> (in
years), the <code>severity</code> of the patient’s illness (also on a
0–100 scale), and the patient’s <code>anxiety</code> score on a standard
anxiety test (scale of 0–5). Higher scores mean greater satisfaction,
increased severity of illness and more anxiety.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Read in the data and check that you have four columns in
your data frame, one for each of your variables.</li>

column headers. Thus, <code>read_table</code> is what we need:</p>

<p>46 rows and 4 columns: satisfaction score (response), age, severity
and anxiety (explanatory).</p>
<p>There is a small question about what to call the data
frame. Basically, anything other than <code>satis</code> will do, since
there will be confusion if your data frame has the same name as one of
its columns.</p>

<p>This is fine, but there is also a way of getting all three plots with
<em>one</em> <code>ggplot</code>. This uses the <code>facet_wrap</code> trick,
but to set <em>that</em> up, we have to have all the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variables in
<em>one</em> column, with an extra column labelling which <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variable
that value was. This uses <code>pivot_longer</code>. The right way to do this is
in a pipeline:</p>

<p>Steps: collect together the columns age through anxiety into one column
whose values go in <code>x</code>, with names in <code>xname</code>, then plot this new
<code>x</code> against satisfaction score, with a separate facet for each
different <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (in <code>xname</code>).</p>
<p>What’s the difference
between <code>facet_grid</code> and <code>facet_wrap</code>? The difference is that with
<code>facet_wrap</code>, we are letting <code>ggplot</code> arrange the
facets how it wants to. In this case, we didn’t care which explanatory
variable went on which facet, just as long as we saw all of them
somewhere. Inside <code>facet_wrap</code> there are <em>no dots</em>: a
squiggle, followed by the name(s) of the variable(s) that
distinguish(es) the facets.
<label for="tufte-mn-103" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-103" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">If there are more than one, they should be separated by plus signs as in lm. Each facet then has as many labels as variables. I haven’t actually done this myself, but from looking at examples, I think this is the way it works.</span>
The only “design” decision I made here was that the facets
should be arranged somehow in two columns, but I didn’t care which
ones should be where.</p>
<p>In <code>facet_grid</code>, you have a variable that you want to be
displayed in rows or in columns (not just in “different facets”).
I’ll show you how that works here. Since I am going to draw
two plots, I should save the long data frame first and re-use it,
rather than calculating it twice (so that I ought now to go back and
do the other one using the saved data frame, really):</p>

<p>If, at this or any stage, you get confused, the way to un-confuse
yourself is to <em>fire up R Studio and do this yourself</em>. You have
all the data and code you need. If you do it yourself, you can run
pipes one line at a time, inspect things, and so on.</p>
<p>First, making a <em>row</em> of plots, so that <code>xname</code> is the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
of the facets:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1228"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1228-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1228-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(satisf.long, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> x, <span class="dt">y =</span> satis)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span></span>
<span id="cb1228-2"><a href="regression.html#cb1228-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">facet_grid</span>(. <span class="op">~</span><span class="st"> </span>xname, <span class="dt">scales =</span> <span class="st">&quot;free&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-823-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I find these too tall and skinny to see the trends, as on the first
<code>facet_wrap</code> plot.</p>
<p>And now, making a <em>column</em> of plots, with <code>xname</code> as <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1229"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1229-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1229-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(satisf.long, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> x, <span class="dt">y =</span> satis)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span></span>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-824-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This one looks weird because the three <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variables are on different

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Does the regression fit well overall? How can you tell?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>For this, look at R-squared, which is 0.682 (68.2%). This is one
of those things to have an opinion about. I’d say this is good but
not great. I would not call it “poor”, since there definitely
<em>is</em> a relationship, even if it’s not a stupendously good one.</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Test the null hypothesis that none of your explanatory
variables help, against the alternative that one or more of them
do. (You’ll need an appropriate P-value. Which one is it?) What do
you conclude?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This one is the (global) <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test, whose P-value is at the
bottom. It translates to 0.000000000154, so this is
<em>definitely</em> small, and we reject the null. Thus, one or more
of <code>age</code>, <code>severity</code> and <code>anxiety</code> helps to
predict satisfaction. (I would like to see this last sentence,
rather than just “reject the null”.)</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The correlation between <code>severity</code> and
<code>satis</code> is not small, but in my regression I found that
<code>severity</code> was nowhere near significant. Why is this? Explain briefly.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The key thing to observe is that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test in the regression
says how important a variable is , or, if you prefer, how much that
variable <em>adds</em> to the regression, on top of the ones that
are already there. So here, we are saying
that <code>severity</code> has nothing to add, given that the
regression already includes the others. (That is, high correlation
and strong significance don’t always go together.)
For a little more insight, look at the correlation matrix of
(<a href="#part:corrmat">here</a>) again. The strongest trend with
<code>satis</code> is with <code>age</code>, and indeed <code>age</code> is
the one obviously significant variable in the regression. The
trend of <code>severity</code> with <code>satis</code> is somewhat
downward, and you might otherwise have guessed that this is strong
enough to be significant. But see that <code>severity</code>
<em>also</em> has a clear relationship with <code>age</code>. A patient
with low severity of disease is probably also younger, and we know
that younger patients are likely to be more satisfied. Thus
severity has nothing (much) to add.
The multiple regression is actually doing something clever
here. Just looking at the correlations, it appears that all three
variables are helpful, but the regression is saying that once you
have looked at <code>age</code> (“controlled for age”),
severity of illness does not have an impact: the correlation of
<code>severity</code> with <code>satis</code> is as big as it is almost
entirely because of <code>age</code>.
This gets into the domain of “partial correlation”. If you like videos, you can
see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF0WAVBIhNA">link</a> for
this. I prefer regression, myself, since I find it clearer.
<code>anxiety</code>
tells a different story: this is close to significant (or
<em>is</em> significant at the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.10\)</span> level), so the
regression is saying that <code>anxiety</code> <em>does</em> appear to
have something to say about <code>satis</code> over and above
<code>age</code>. This is rather odd, to my mind, since
<code>anxiety</code> has only a slightly stronger correlation with
<code>satis</code> and about the same with <code>age</code> as
<code>severity</code> does. But the regression is telling the story to
believe, because it handles all the inter-correlations, not just
the ones between pairs of variables.
I thought it would be rather interesting to do some predictions
here. Let’s predict satisfaction for all combinations of high and
low age, severity and anxiety. I’ll use the quartiles for high and
low. There is a straightforward but ugly way:</p>

<p>The place where this approach gains is when <code>pivot_longer</code> goes too far, making <em>everything</em> longer, when you want some of it to be wider and thus you needed a <code>pivot_wider</code> at the end. Once again, you use two things in the <code>names_to</code>, but this time instead of giving both variables names, you use the special name <code>.value</code> for the thing you want to end up in columns. The original data frame <code>quartiles</code> had columns with names like <code>severity_q1</code>, so here that is the first thing: <code>age</code> and <code>severity</code> and <code>anxiety</code> will be used as column names, and filled automatically with the values for <code>q1</code> and <code>q3</code>, so you don’t specify a <code>values_to</code>.</p>
<p>This is one of those very dense pieces of coding, where you accomplish a lot in a small space. If it is too dense for you, you can go back to one of the two previous ways of doing it, eg. the simple <code>pivot_longer</code> followed by <code>separate</code> followed by <code>pivot_wider</code>. Sometimes there is value in using a larger number of simpler tools to get where you want.</p>
<p>Those data frames above are we want for below. Let’s test the first way of coding it line by line to see exactly

<p>I make <code>var_name</code> wider, carrying along the values in
<code>quartile</code> (which means that the rows will get matched up by
<code>which_q</code>).</p>
<p>Now, let’s think about why we were doing that. We want to do
predictions of all possible combinations of those values of age and
anxiety and severity.
Doing “all possible combinations” calls for <code>crossing</code>,
which looks like this. It uses the output from one of the above pipelines, which I saved in <code>qq</code>:</p>

<p>Looking at the predictions themselves (in <code>fit</code>), you can see
that <code>age</code> has a huge effect. If you compare the 1st and 5th
lines (or the 2nd and 6th, 3rd and 7th, ) you see that
increasing age by 13.5 years, while leaving the other variables the
same, decreases the satisfaction score by over 15 on
average. Changing <code>severity</code>, while leaving everything else the
same, has in comparison a tiny effect, just over 2 points. (Compare
eg. 1st and 2nd lines.) Anxiety has an in-between effect: increasing
anxiety from 2.1 to 2.475, leaving everything else fixed, decreases
satisfaction by about 5 points on average.</p>
<p>I chose the quartiles on purpose: to demonstrate the change in average
satisfaction by changing the explanatory variable by an appreciable
fraction of its range of values. That is, I changed <code>severity</code>
by “a fair bit”, and still the effect on satisfaction scores was small.</p>
<p>Are any of these prediction intervals longer or shorter? We can calculate how
long they are. Look at the predictions:</p>

<p>Two of these are noticeably shorter than the others. These are high-everything and low-everything. If you
look back at the scatterplot matrix of (<a href="#part:scatmat">here</a>), you’ll
see that the explanatory variables have positive correlations with
each other. This means that when one of them is low, the other ones
will tend to be low as well (and correspondingly high with high). That
is, most of the data is at or near the low-low-low end or the
high-high-high end, and so those values will be easiest to predict for.</p>
<p>I was actually expecting more of an effect, but what I expected is
actually there.</p>
<p>In the backward elimination part (coming up), I found that only
<code>age</code> and <code>anxiety</code> had a significant impact on
satisfaction, so I can plot these two explanatory variables against
each other to see where most of the values are:</p>

be longer).</p>

of <code>severity</code>, and run it again. But when I have a
“small change” to make to a model, I like to use <code>update</code>.</p>
<p>Having taken <code>severity</code> out, <code>anxiety</code> has become

<p>with the same result. This function doesn’t actually use P-values;
instead it uses a thing called AIC. At each step, the variable with
the lowest AIC comes out, and when <code>&lt;none&gt;</code> bubbles up to the
top, that’s when you stop. The <code>test="F"</code> means
“include an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test”, but the procedure still uses AIC (it just shows you an
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test each time as well). In this case, the other variables were
in the same order throughout, but they don’t have to be (in the same
way that removing one variable from a multiple regression can
dramatically change the P-values of the ones that remain). Here, at
the first step, <code>&lt;none&gt;</code> and <code>anxiety</code> were pretty
close, but when <code>severity</code> came out, taking out nothing was a
<em>lot</em> better than taking out <code>anxiety</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>test="F"</code> on the end gets you the P-values. Using the
<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test is right for regressions; for things like logistic regression
that we see later, <code>test="Chisq"</code> is the right one to
use.

<p>The alignment of columns means that we need to use

search for help by typing <code>?read_table</code> in the Console
window (the help will appear bottom right), or you can put the
same thing into an R Notebook code chunk, and when you run the

back to the notebook.)
Or you can Google it, of course.

<p>There is no <code>skip</code> here, because the data file starts right
away with the data and we want to use all the values: we are

<li>Explain carefully but briefly what the slope coefficients
for the two explanatory variables represent. Do their signs
(positive or negative) make practical sense in the context of
handling shipments of chemicals?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The slope coefficient for <code>drums</code> is 3.77; this means that
a shipment with one extra drum (but the same total weight) would
take on average 3.77 minutes longer to handle. Likewise, the slope
coefficient for <code>weight</code> is 5.08, so a shipment that
weighs 1 hundred more pounds but has the same number of drums
will take 5.08 more minutes to handle.
Or “each additional drum, all else equal, will take 3.77 more minutes to handle”, or similar wording. You have to get at two
things: a one-unit increase in the explanatory variable going with
a certain increase in the response, and <em>also</em> the “all else equal” part. How you say it is up to you, but you need to say it.
That was two marks. The third one comes from noting that both
slope coefficients are positive, so making a shipment either
contain more drums or weigh more makes the handling time longer as
well. This makes perfect sense, since either kind of increase
would make the shipment more difficult to handle, and thus take
longer.
I was <em>not</em> asking about P-values. There isn’t really much to
say about those: they’re both significant, so the handling time
depends on both the total weight and the number of drums. Removing
either from the regression would be a mistake.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Obtain plots of residuals against fitted values, residuals
against explanatory variables, and a normal quantile plot of the residuals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>These are the standard plots from a multiple regression. The
second one requires care, but the first and last should be straightforward.
Residuals against fitted values:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1265"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1265-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1265-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(minutes<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-849-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The tricky part about the second one is that the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-values and the
residuals come from different data frames, which has to get expressed
in the <code>ggplot</code>. The obvious way is to do the two plots (one
for each explanatory variable) one at a time:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1266"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1266-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1266-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(minutes<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> chemicals<span class="op">$</span>drums, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-850-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>and</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1267"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1267-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1267-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(minutes<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> chemicals<span class="op">$</span>weight, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-851-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>What would also work is to make a data frame first with the things to plot:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1268"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1268-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1268-1"></a>dd &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">tibble</span>(<span class="dt">weight =</span> chemicals<span class="op">$</span>weight, <span class="dt">drums =</span> chemicals<span class="op">$</span>drums, <span class="dt">res =</span> <span class="kw">resid</span>(minutes<span class="fl">.1</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1269"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1269-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1269-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(dd, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> weight, <span class="dt">y =</span> res)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-853-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>and similarly for <code>drums</code>. The <code>resid</code> with the model
name in brackets seems to be necessary.</p>
<p>Another way to approach this is <code>augment</code> from
<code>broom</code>. That does this:</p>

<p>As a check for the grader, there should be four plots, obtained
somehow: residuals against fitted values, normal quantile plot of
residuals, residuals against <code>drums</code>, residuals against<br />
<code>weight</code>.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Do you have any concerns, looking at the residual plots?
Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The (only) concern I have, looking at those four plots, is the one very
positive residual, the one around 15. Take that away, and I think
all of the plots are then acceptable.
Alternatively, I will take something like “I have no concerns about the form of the relationship”, saying that the <em>kind</em>
of model being fitted here is OK (no evidence of non-linearity,
fanning out, that kind of stuff). It’s up to you to decide whether
you think “concerns” extends to outliers, high-influence points,
etc.
The normal quantile plot reveals that the most negative residual,
the one around <span class="math inline">\(-9\)</span>, is in fact almost exactly as negative as you
would expect the most negative residual to be, so it is not an
outlier at all. The residuals are almost exactly normally
distributed, <em>except</em> for the most positive one.
I don’t think you can justify fanning-in, since the evidence for
that is mostly from the single point on the right. The other
points do not really have residuals closer to zero as you move
left to right.</p>
<p>Do <em>not</em> be tempted to pick out everything you can think of wrong
with these plots. The grader can, and will, take away points if you
start naming things that are not concerns.</p>
<p>Extra: what else can I find out about that large-positive-residual
point? This is where having the “augmented” data frame is a plus:</p>

<p>so it’s a bit of a mystery why it took so long to handle.</p>
<p>I had some fun with the graph: if you set <code>colour</code> equal to a
continuous variable (as <code>minutes</code> is here), you get a
continuous colour scale, by default from dark blue (small) to light
blue (large). The number of minutes tends to get larger (lighter) as
you go up and to the right with bigger shipments. The point labelled
“residual +” is the one with the large residual; it is a
noticeably lighter blue than the points around it, meaning that it
took longer to handle than those points. I used the trick from C32 to
label “some” (here one) of the points: create a new label variable
with a <code>mutate</code> and an <code>ifelse</code>, leaving all of the
other labels blank so you don’t see them.</p>
<p>The blue colour scheme is a little hard to judge values on. Here’s
another way to do that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1278"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1278-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1278-1"></a>d <span class="op">%&gt;%</span></span>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-862-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The labelled point is a little more blue (purplish) than the more
clearly red points near it.</p>
<p>The other thing to see is that there is also a positive correlation
between the number of drums and the total weight, which is what you’d
expect. Unlike with some of our other examples, this wasn’t strong
enough to cause problems; the separate effects of <code>drums</code> and
<code>weight</code> on <code>minutes</code> were distinguishable enough to
allow both explanatory variables to have a strongly significant effect
on <code>minutes</code>.</p>
<p>Post scriptum: the “drums” here are not concert-band-type drums, but
something like this:</p>

<p>If you don’t see how that works, run it yourself, one line at a time.</p>
<p>I was thinking ahead a bit while I was coding that: I wanted the three
plots to come out about square, and I wanted the plots to have their
own scales. The last thing in the <code>facet_wrap</code> does the latter,
and arranging the plots in two columns (thinking of the plots as a set
of four with one missing) gets them more or less square.</p>

<p>To my mind, all of the three relationships are going uphill (that’s the “direction” part). <code>experience</code> is the
strongest, and <code>pubsucc</code> looks the weakest (that’s the
“strength” part). If you want to say there is no relationship
with <code>pubsucc</code>, that’s fine too. This is a judgement
call.
Note that all the relationships are more or less linear (no
obvious curves here). We could also investigate the relationships
among the explanatory variables:</p>

<li>How can we justify the statement
“one or more of the explanatory variables helps to predict salary”? How is this

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>“One or more of the explanatory variables helps” is an
invitation to consider the (global) <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test for the whole
regression. This has the very small P-value of <span class="math inline">\(1.124\times 10^{-10}\)</span> (from the bottom line of the output): very small, so
one or more of the explanatory variables <em>does</em> help, and
the statement is correct.
The idea that something helps to predict salary suggests
(especially with such a small number of observations) that we
should have a high R-squared. In this case, R-squared is 0.9109,
which is indeed high.</p>

<li>Would you consider removing any of the variables from this

<p>Look at the P-values attached to each variable. These are all
very small: 0.003, 0.00000003 and 0.0003, way smaller than
0.05. So it would be a mistake to
take any, even one, of the variables out: doing so would make the
regression much worse.
If you need convincing of that, see what happens when we take
the variable with the highest P-value out — this is <code>workqual</code>:</p>

<p>R-squared has gone down from 91% to 86%: maybe not so much in the
grand scheme of things, but it is noticeably less. Perhaps better,
since we are comparing models with different numbers of explanatory
variables, is to compare the <em>adjusted</em> R-squared: this has gone
down from 90% to 85%. The fact that this has gone down <em>at all</em>
is enough to say that taking out <code>workqual</code> was a
mistake.

<p>I think it would be a big mistake. Taking even one of these

<p>and then use <code>anova</code> to compare the two regressions, smaller
model first:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1293"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1293-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1293-1"></a><span class="kw">anova</span>(salaries<span class="fl">.3</span>, salaries<span class="fl">.1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

  </script>
</div>
<p>The P-value is extremely small, so the bigger model is definitely
better than the smaller one: we really do need all three
variables. Which is what we guessed.</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Back in part (<a href="#regone">here</a>), you fitted a regression with all
three explanatory variables. By making suitable plots, assess
whether there is any evidence that (i) that the linear model should
be a curve, (ii) that the residuals are not normally
distributed, (iii) that there is “fan-out”, where the residuals are getting
bigger <em>in size</em> as the fitted values get bigger? Explain
briefly how you came to your conclusions in each case.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I intended that (i) should just be a matter of looking at residuals
vs. fitted values:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1294"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1294-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1294-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(salaries<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-870-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>There is no appreciable pattern on here, so no evidence of a curve (or
apparently of any other problems).</p>
<p>Extra: you might read this that we should check residuals against the
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variables as well, which is a similar trick to the above one for
plotting response against each of the explanatories. There is one step
first, though: use <code>augment</code> from <code>broom</code> first to get a
dataframe with the original <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variables <em>and</em> the residuals in
it. The following thus looks rather complicated, and if it confuses
you, run the code a piece at a time to see what it’s doing:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1295"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1295-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1295-1"></a>salaries<span class="fl">.1</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span></span>

<span id="cb1295-5"><a href="regression.html#cb1295-5"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">facet_wrap</span>(<span class="op">~</span>xname, <span class="dt">scales =</span> <span class="st">&quot;free&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">ncol =</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-871-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>These three residual plots are also pretty much textbook random, so no problems here either.</p>
<p>For (ii), look at a normal quantile plot of the residuals, which is not as difficult as the plot I just did:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1296"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1296-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1296-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(salaries<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-872-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>That is really pretty good. Maybe the <em>second</em> smallest point is
a bit far off the line, but otherwise there’s nothing to worry about. A
quick place to look for problems is the extreme observations, and the
largest and smallest residuals are almost exactly the size we’d expect
them to be.</p>
<p>Our graph for assessing fan-in or fan-out is to plot the <em>absolute</em> values of the residuals against the fitted values. The plot from (i) suggests that we won’t have any problems here, but to investigate:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1297"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1297-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1297-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(salaries<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="kw">abs</span>(.resid))) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-873-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This is pretty nearly straight across. You might think it increases a
bit at the beginning, but most of the evidence for that comes from the
one observation with fitted value near 30 that happens to have a
residual near zero. Conclusions based on one observation are not to be
trusted!
In summary, I’m happy with this linear multiple regression, and I
don’t see any need to do anything more with it. I am, however, willing
to have some sympathy with opinions that differ from mine, if they are
supported by those graphs above.</p>

<li>Describe any relationship on your scatterplot: its direction, its
strength and its shape. Justify your description briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Taking these points one at a time:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>direction: upward (a higher high-school GPA generally goes
with a higher university GPA as well. Or you can say that the
lowest high-school GPAs go with the lowest university GPAs,
and high with high, at least most of the time).</p></li>
<li><p>strength: something like moderately strong, since while
the trend is upward, there is quite a lot of scatter. (This is
a judgement call: something that indicates that you are basing
your description on something reasonable is fine.)</p></li>
<li><p>shape: I’d call this “approximately linear” since there
is no clear curve here. The smooth trend wiggles a bit, but
not enough to make me doubt a straight line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking ahead, I also notice that when high-school GPA is high,
university GPA is also consistently high, but when high-school
GPA is low, the university GPA is sometimes low and sometimes
high, a lot more variable. (This suggests problems with fan-in
later.) In a practical sense, what this seems to show is that
people who do well at university usually did well in high-school
as well, but sometimes their high-school grades were not
that good. This is especially true for people with university
GPAs around 3.25.</p>

<p>Extra: this question goes on too long, so I didn’t ask you to look at the
residuals from this model, but my comments earlier suggested that we
might have had some problems with fanning-in (the variability of
predictions getting less as the high-school GPA increases). In case
you are interested, I’ll look at this here. First, residuals against
fitted values:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1306"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1306-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1306-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(gpa<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-877-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Is that evidence of a trend in the residuals? Dunno. I’m inclined to
call this an “inconsequential wiggle” and say it’s OK. Note that the
grey envelope includes zero all the way across.</p>
<p>Normal quantile plot of residuals:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1308"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1308-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1308-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(gpa<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-878-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>A somewhat long-tailed distribution: compared to a normal
distribution, the residuals are a bit too big in size, both on the
positive and negative end.</p>
<p>The problem I was really worried about was the potential of
fanning-in, which we can assess by looking at the absolute residuals:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1309"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1309-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1309-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(gpa<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="kw">abs</span>(.resid))) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-879-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>That is definitely a downward trend in the size of the residuals, and
I think I was right to be worried before. The residuals should be of
similar size all the way across.</p>
<p>The usual problem of this kind is fanning-<em>out</em>, where the
residuals get <em>bigger</em> in size as the fitted values increase. The
bigger values equals more spread is the kind of thing that a
transformation like taking logs will handle: the bigger values are all
brought downwards, so they will be both smaller and less variable than
they were. This one, though, goes the other way, so the only kind of
transformation that might help is one at the other end of the scale
(think of the Box-Cox lambda scale), something like maybe reciprocal,
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda=-1\)</span> maybe.</p>
<p>The other thought I had was that there is this kind of break around a
high-school GPA of 3 (go back to the scatterplot of (<a href="#part:hsu-scatter">here</a>)): when the
high-school GPA is higher than 3, the university GPA is very
consistent (and shows a clear upward trend), but when the high-school
GPA is less than 3, the university GPA is very variable and there
doesn’t seem to be any trend at all. So maybe two separate analyses
would be the way to go.</p>
<p>All right, how does Box-Cox work out here, if at all?</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1311"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1311-1"><a href="regression.html#cb1311-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(MASS)</span>

<p>Since we are talking about individual students, rather than

<p>Thus the predicted university GPA for the student with high school GPA
3.0 is between 2.6 and 3.7, and for the student with high school GPA
3.5 is between 2.9 and 4.0. (I think this is a good number of decimals
to give, but in any case, you should actually <em>say</em> what the
intervals are.)</p>
<p>I observe that these intervals are almost exactly the same
length. This surprises me a bit, since I would have said that 3.0 is
close to the average high-school GPA and 3.5 is noticeably higher. If
that’s the case, the prediction interval for 3.5 should be longer
(since there is less “nearby data”). Was I right about that?</p>

<p>More or less: the mean is close to 3, and 3.5 is close to the third

<p>These intervals are a lot shorter, since we are talking about
<em>all</em> students with the high-school GPAs in question, and we
therefore no longer have to worry about variation from student to
student (which is considerable). But my supposition about length is
now correct: the interval for 3.5, which is further from the mean, is
a little longer than the interval for 3.0. Thinking about it, it seems
that the individual-to-individual variation, which is large, is
dominating things for our prediction interval above.</p>

<p>Here is where we have to stop, since both high-school GPA and
verbal SAT score are significant, and so taking either of them
out would be a bad idea.
This is a <em>different</em> model than the one of
(<a href="#part:highonly">here</a>). This is the case, even though the model
with high-school GPA only was not significantly worse than the
model containing everything. (This goes to show that
model-building doesn’t always have nice clear answers.)
In the model I called <code>gpa.2</code>, neither of the SAT
scores were anywhere near significant (considered singly), but
as soon as we took out one of the SAT scores (my model
<code>gpa.3</code>), the other one became significant. This goes
to show that you shouldn’t take out more than one explanatory
variable based on the results of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests, and even if
you test to see whether you should have taken out both of the SAT,
you won’t necessarily get consistent
results. Admittedly, it’s a close decision whether to
keep or remove <code>verb_SAT</code>, since its P-value is
close to 0.05.
The other way of tackling this one is via <code>step</code>, which

<p>This gives the same result as we did from our backward
elimination. The tables with AIC in them are each step of
the elimination, and the variable at the top is the one that comes out
next. (When <code>&lt;none&gt;</code> gets to the top, that’s when you stop.)
What happened is that the two SAT scores started off highest, but once
we removed <code>math_SAT</code>, <code>verb_SAT</code> jumped below
<code>&lt;none&gt;</code> and so the verbal SAT score had to stay.</p>
<p>Both the P-value and the AIC say that the decision about keeping or
removing <code>verb_SAT</code> is very close.</p>

<li>These students were studying computer science at
university. Do you find your backward-elimination result
sensible or surprising, given this? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I would expect computer science students to be strong students
generally, good at math and possibly not so good with
words. So it is not surprising that high-school GPA figures
into the prediction, but I would expect math SAT score to have
an impact also, and it does not. It is also rather surprising
that verbal SAT score predicts success at university for these
computer science students; you wouldn’t think that having
better skills with words would be helpful. So I’m surprised.
Here, I’m looking for some kind of discussion about what’s in
the final backward-elimination model, and what you would
expect to be true of computer science students.
Let’s look at the final model from the backward elimination again:</p>

<p>The two slope estimates are both positive, meaning that, all else
equal, a higher value for each explanatory variable goes with a higher
university GPA. This indicates that a higher verbal SAT score goes
with a higher university GPA: this is across all the university
courses that a student takes, which you would expect to be math and
computer science courses for a Comp Sci student, but might include
a few electives or writing courses. Maybe what is happening is that
the math SAT score is telling the same story as the high-school GPA
for these students, and the verbal SAT score is saying something
different. (For example, prospective computer science students are
mostly likely to have high math SAT scores, so there’s not much
information there.)</p>
<p>I think I need to look at the correlations:</p>

<p>We’ll ignore <code>comp_GPA</code> (i) because we haven’t been thinking
about it and (ii) because it’s highly correlated with the university
GPA anyway. (There isn’t a sense that one of the two university GPAs
is explanatory and the other is a response, since students are taking
the courses that contribute to them at the same time.)</p>
<p>The highest correlation with university GPA of what remains is
high-school GPA, so it’s not at all surprising that this features in
all our regressions. The correlations between university GPA and the
two SAT scores are about equal, so there appears to be no reason to
favour one of the SAT scores over the other. But, the two SAT scores
are highly correlated with <em>each other</em> (0.835), which suggests
that if you have one, you don’t need the other, because they are
telling more or less the same story.</p>
<p>That makes me wonder how a regression with the SAT math score and
<em>not</em> the SAT verbal score would look:</p>

<p>Math SAT does not quite significantly add anything to the prediction,
which confirms that we do better to use the verbal SAT score
(surprising though it seems). Though, the two regressions with the
single SAT scores, <code>gpa.3</code> and <code>gpa.4</code>, have almost the
same R-squared values. It’s not clear-cut at all. In the end, you have
to make a call and stand by it.</p>
