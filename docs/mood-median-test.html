<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Sugar in breakfast cereals</h2>
<p>The data for this question are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/cereal-sugar.txt">http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/cereal-sugar.txt</a>. The
story here is whether breakfast cereals marketed to children have a

average than cereals marketed to adults.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

a variable that distinguishes the children’s cereals from the
adults’ cereals, and another that contains the amount of sugar?</p></li>

adults’ ones and the children’s ones). Do they look similar or different?</p></li>
<li><p>Make side-by-side boxplots of the sugar contents of the two

<li><p>Explain briefly why you would not trust a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test
with these data. (That is, say what the problem is, and why it’s a
problem.)</p></li>
<li><p>Run a suitable test to see whether the “typical” amount of
sugar differs between adult’s and children’s cereals. Justify the test
that you run. (You can use the version of your test that lives in a
package, if that is easier for you.) What do you conclude, in the

<div id="fear-of-math" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Fear of math</h2>
<p>Two new short courses have been proposed for helping
students who suffer from severe math phobia. The courses are labelled
A and B. Ten students were randomly allocated to one of these two
courses, and each student’s score on a math phobia test was recorded
after they completed their course. The math phobia test produces
whole-number scores between 0 and 10, with a higher score indicating a
greater fear of mathematics. The data can be found in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/mathphobia.txt">link</a>. We start
with R for this question.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Read in the data and check, however you like, that you have 10
observations, 5 from each course.</p></li>
<li><p>Do a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test to assess whether there is a
difference in mean phobia scores after the students have taken the two
courses. What do you conclude? (You have no <label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> That is, before looking at the data.

The “posterior distribution” comes from the Latin <em>a posteriori</em>, which means <em>afterwards</em>, that is, after you have looked at the data.</span>

suppose that a particular one of the tests will produce a higher mean
than the other, so do a two-sided test.)</p></li>
<li><p>Draw boxplots of the math phobia scores for each group (one
line of code). What is the most striking thing that you notice?</p></li>
<li><p>Explain briefly why a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test would not be good for these
data. (There are two things that you need to say.)</p></li>

building your own.) What do you conclude?</p></li>

<div id="medical-instructions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Medical instructions</h2>
<p>Do people understand medical instructions better at certain
times of the day? In a study, students in a grade 12 class are
randomly divided into two groups, A and B. All students see a video
describing how to use an infant forehead thermometer. The students in
Group A see the video at 8:30 am, while the students in Group B see
the same video at 3:00 pm (on the same day). The next day, all the
students are given a test on the material in the video (graded out of
100). The observed scores are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/forehead.txt">link</a> (values
separated by spaces).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Read the data into R and display the (first ten) values.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain a suitable plot that will enable you to assess the
assumptions for a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test.</p></li>
<li><p>Why might you have doubts about using a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test here?</p></li>
<li><p>Run Mood’s median test as in class (<em>without</em> using
<code>smmr</code>). What do you conclude, in the context of the data?
What recommendation would you make about the time of day to see the
video? (You might get a warning about “chisquared approximation being incorrect”,
which you can ignore here.)</p></li>

package, and verify that you get the same answer.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.4</span> Handspans revisited</h2>
<p>Take your right hand, and stretch the fingers out as far as
you can. The distance between the tip of your thumb and the tip of
your little (pinky) finger is your handspan. The students in a
Statistics class at Penn State measured their handspans and also
whether they identified as male or female. The data are at

measured in inches. We want to
see whether male students have a larger mean handspan than female students.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Read in and display (some of) the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a suitable (facetted) normal quantile plot of the data. (Bear in
mind what is supposed to have a normal distribution.)</p></li>

test to compare the handspans of the male and female students,

<p>Solution</p>
<p>The problem is the outliers (which is rather a giveaway), but the
reason it’s a problem is that the two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test assumes
(approximately) normal data, and a normal distribution doesn’t
have outliers.
Not only do you need to note the outliers, but you also need to

<p>Having ruled out the two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, we are left with Mood’s

<p>We conclude that there <em>is</em> a difference between the median
amounts of sugar between the two groups of cereals, the P-value of 0.00000007
being extremely small.</p>
<p>Why did it come out so small? Because the amount of sugar was smaller
than the overall median for almost all the adult cereals, and larger
than the overall median for almost all the children’s ones. That is,
the children’s cereals really do have more sugar.</p>
<p>Mood’s median test doesn’t come with a confidence interval (for the
difference in population medians), because whether or not a certain
difference in medians is rejected depends on what those medians
actually are, and the idea of the duality of the test and CI doesn’t
carry over as we would like.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.6</span> Fear of math</h2>
<p>Two new short courses have been proposed for helping
students who suffer from severe math phobia. The courses are labelled
A and B. Ten students were randomly allocated to one of these two
courses, and each student’s score on a math phobia test was recorded
after they completed their course. The math phobia test produces
whole-number scores between 0 and 10, with a higher score indicating a
greater fear of mathematics. The data can be found in

<p>Extra: there is an experimental design issue here. You might have noticed that each student did only <em>one</em> of the courses. Couldn’t students do both, in a matched-pairs kind of way? Well, it’s a bit like the kids learning to read in that if the first of the courses reduces a student’s anxiety, the second course won’t appear to do much good (even if it actually would have been helpful had the student done that one first). This is the same idea as the kids learning to read: once you’ve learned to read, you’ve learned to read, and learning to read a second way won’t help much. The place where matched pairs scores is when you can “wipe out” the effect of one treatment before a subject gets the other one. We have an example of kids throwing baseballs and softballs that is like that: if you throw one kind of ball, that won’t affect how far you can throw the other kind.</p>

<li>Explain briefly why a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test would not be good for these

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The easiest way to structure this is to ask yourself first what the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test needs, and second whether you have it.
The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test assumes (approximately) normal data. The boxplot for
group <code>a</code> doesn’t even look symmetric, and the one for group
<code>b</code> has an oddly asymmetric box. So I think the normality is
in question here, and therefore another test would be
better. (This is perhaps a bit glib of an answer, since there are
only 5 values in each group, and so they can certainly look
non-normal even if they actually are normal, but these values are
all integers, so it is perhaps wise to be cautious.)
We have the machinery to assess the normality for these, in one shot:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I don’t know what <em>you</em> make of those, but they both look pretty
straight to me (and there are only five observations, so it’s hard to
judge). Course <code>b</code> maybe has a “hole” in it (three large
values and two small ones). Maybe. I dunno. What I would <em>really</em>
be worried about is outliers, and at least we don’t have those.
I mentioned in class that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests are robust to non-normality. I
ought to have expanded on that a bit: what really makes the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test
still behave itself with non-normality is when you have <em>large</em>
samples, that is, when the Central Limit Theorem has had a chance to
take hold. (That’s what drives the normality not really being
necessary in most cases.) But, even with small samples, exact
normality doesn’t matter so much. Here, we have two tiny samples, and
so we have to insist a bit more, but only a bit more, on a
more-or-less normal shape in each group. (It’s kind of a double
jeopardy in that the situation where normality matters most, namely
with small samples, is where it’s the hardest to judge, because
samples of size 5 even from a normal distribution can look very
non-normal.)
But, the biggest threats to the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test are big-time skewness and
outliers, and we are not suffering too badly from those.</p>

equal to the overall median. Of the rest, all the small ones were in
group 1 and all the large ones were in group 2. This is lopsided

<p>Solution</p>
<p>We are looking for non-normality in at least one of the
groups. Here, both groups have an outlier at the low end that
would be expected to pull the mean downward. I don’t think there
is left-skewness here, since there is no particular evidence of
the high-end values being bunched up: the problem in both cases
with normality is at the low end.
One way or another, I’m expecting you to have noticed the outliers.
Extra: last year, when I first drew the normal quantile plots,
there was no <code>stat_qq_line</code>, so you had to imagine where
the line went if you did it this way. Without the line, these
plots look somewhat curved, which would have pointed to
left-skewness, but now we see that the lowest observation is too
low, and maybe the second-lowest one as well, while the other
observations are just fine.</p>

  </script>
</div>
<p>87.5, which is not equal to any of the data values (they are all
integers). This will avoid any issues with values-equal-to-median later.</p>
<p>Then, create and save a table of the value by group and above/below
median. You can count either above or below (it comes out equivalently
either way):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb66"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb66-1" title="1">tab &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">with</span>(instr, <span class="kw">table</span>(group, score <span class="op">&gt;</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="fl">87.5</span>))</a>

## group FALSE TRUE
##     A     2    8
##     B     7    1</code></pre>
<p>Then, chi-squared test for independence (the null) or association of
some kind (the alternative). The <code>correct=F</code> is saying not to
do Yates’s correction, so that it would come out the same if you were
doing it by hand (“observed minus expected, squared, divided by expected”
and all that stuff).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb68"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-1" title="1"><span class="kw">chisq.test</span>(tab, <span class="dt">correct =</span> F)</a></code></pre></div>

##  Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test
## 
## data:  tab
## X-squared = 8.1, df = 1, p-value = 0.004427</code></pre>
<p>The P-value is 0.0044, which is (much) smaller than 0.05, and
therefore you can reject independence and conclude association: that
is, whether a student scores above or below the median depends on
which group they are in, or, that the median scores are different for
the two groups.</p>
<p>The warning is because the expected frequencies are on the small side
(if you have done this kind of problem by hand, you might remember
something about “expected frequencies less than 5”. This is that.)
Here, the P-value is so small that we can afford to have it be
inaccurate by a bit and still not affect the conclusion, so I think we
are safe.</p>
<p>As for which group is better, well, the easiest way is to go back to
your boxplots and see that the median for group A (8:30 am) is
substantially higher than for group B (3:00pm). But you can also see
it from your frequency table, if you displayed it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb71"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb71-1" title="1">tab</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##      
## group FALSE TRUE
##     A     2    8
##     B     7    1</code></pre>
<p>Most of the people in the 8:30 am group scored above the median, and
most of the people in the 3:00 pm group scored below the median. So
the scores at 8:30 am were better overall.</p>
<p>As I write this, it is just after 3:00 pm and I am about to make
myself a pot of tea!</p>
<p>Extra: about that <code>correct=F</code> thing. There was a point of view for a
long time that when you are dealing with a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> table, you can
get better P-values by, before squaring “observed minus expected”,
taking 0.5 away from the absolute value of the difference. This is
called Yates’s correction. It is in the same spirit as the
“continuity correction” that you might have encountered in the
normal approximation to the binomial, where in the binomial you have
to have a whole number of successes, but the normal allows fractional
values as well. In about the 1960s, the usefulness of Yates’s
correction was shot down, for general contingency tables. There is,
however, one case where it <em>is</em> useful, and that is the case
where the row totals and column totals are <em>fixed</em>.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that? Well, first let’s look at a case where the
totals are <em>not</em> all fixed. Consider a survey in which you want
to see whether males and females agree or disagree on some burning
issue of the day. You collect random samples of, say, 500 males and
500 females, and you count how many of them say Yes or No to your
statement.<label for="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">8</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">8</span> To simplify things, we’ll assume that everyone gave a Yes or a No answer, though you could add a column like “No answer” if you wanted to make it more realistic.</span>
You might get results like this:</p>
<pre><code>
Yes  No  Total
Males    197 303   500
Females  343 157   500
Total    540 460  1000
</code></pre>
<p>In this table, the row totals must be 500, because you asked this many
males and this many females, and each one must have answered
something. The column totals, however, are not fixed: you didn’t know,
ahead of time, that 540 people would answer “yes”. That was just the
way the data turned out, and if you did another survey with the same
design, you’d probably get a different number of people saying
“yes”.</p>
<p>For another example, let’s go back to Fisher (yes, <em>that</em>
Fisher). A “lady” of his acquaintance claimed to be able, by
drinking a cup of tea with milk and sugar in it, whether the milk or
the sugar had been added first. Fisher, or, more likely, his
housekeeper, prepared 8 cups of tea, 4 with milk first and 4 with
sugar first. The lady knew that four of the cups had milk first, and
her job was to say which four. The results might have been like this:</p>
<pre><code>
Actual 
Milk first  sugar first  Total
Lady   Milk first        3            1         4
says   sugar first       1            3         4
Total             4            4         8
</code></pre>
<p>This time, all of the row totals and all of the column totals must be
4, regardless of what the lady thinks. Even if she thinks 5 of the
cups of tea actually had milk first, she is going to pick 4 of them to
say that they have milk first, since she knows there are only 4. In
this case, all of the row and column totals are fixed at 4, and the
right analysis is called Fisher’s Exact Test, based on the
hypergeometric distribution. In a <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> table like this one,
there is only one “degree of freedom”, since as soon as you specify
one of the frequencies, say the number of cups where the lady said
milk first and they actually were milk first, you can work out the
others. But, leaving that aside, the usual chi-squared analysis is a
perfectly good approximation, especially if the frequencies are large,
and especially if you use Yates’s correction.</p>
<p>It is clear that Fisher must have been English, since he was able to
get a publication out of drinking tea.</p>
<p>How does that apply to Mood’s median test? Well, let’s remind
ourselves of the table we had:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb75"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb75-1" title="1">tab</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##      
## group FALSE TRUE
##     A     2    8
##     B     7    1</code></pre>
<p>We know how many students were in each group: 10 in group A and 8 in
B. So the row totals are fixed. What about the columns? These are
whether each observation was above or below the overall median. There
were 18 observations altogether, so there <em>must</em> be 9 above and 9
below.<label for="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">9</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">9</span> Except in the case of the previous problem, where there were multiple observations equal to the overall median. Which we ignore for the moment.</span>
So the column totals are fixed as well. All
totals fixed, so we should be using Yates’s correction. I didn’t,
because I wanted to keep things simple, but I should have done.</p>
<p>R’s <code>chisq.test</code> by default <em>always</em> uses Yates’s
correction, and if you don’t want it, you have to say
<code>correct=F</code>. Which is why I have been doing so all through.</p>

<li>Discuss briefly whether you might prefer to use Mood’s median
test to compare the handspans of the male and female students,
compared to a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>A two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test assumes that each of the two samples comes
from a (approximately) normal distribution (“the data
are normal” is not precise enough). The female values, on the left, definitely have some
outliers at the low end (or a long lower tail), so these are
definitely not normal.
The male values (on the right) are
slightly skewed to the left, or there are some mild outliers at the low end, or, if you prefer, these are
approximately normal.
(You need discussion of each of the males and
females, or of why looking at one group is enough.) Because the males are not close enough to normal (or,
because neither group is close enough to normal), we would prefer
to use Mood’s median test. (Say this.) You do yourself a favour by making it clear that you know that <em>both</em> groups have to be normal enough;
if one is good but the other is not, that is not enough.</p>
<p>The other relevant issue is sample size. The best answer discusses that as well, even though you have a lot to think about already. This data set has 190 observations in it, so the samples must be pretty big:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb83"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb83-1" title="1">span <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">count</span>(sex)</a></code></pre></div>

  </script>
</div>
<p>With these sample sizes, we can expect a lot of help from the central limit theorem. The apparent outliers in the males won’t be a problem, and maybe we could even get away with those
outliers in the females.</p>
<p>Extra: you could also think about bootstrapped sampling distributions of the sample mean here. The one we are most concerned about is the females; if it turns out that they are all right, then the males must be all right too, since the plot for them is showing less non-normality (or, without the double negative, is closer to being normal). So let’s do the females:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-70-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>My take is that the sampling distribution of the sample mean for the females is normal enough, therefore the one for the males is also normal enough, therefore the two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is actually fine.</p>
<p>The reason that this one is close to normal is different from the other one, though. In the other question, we had milder non-normality but a smaller sample; in this one, the data distribution is less normal, but we had a much larger sample size to compensate.</p>

<p>The P-value of <span class="math inline">\(2.66 \times 10^{-19}\)</span> is extremely small, so we
can conclude that males and females have different median
handspans. Remember that we are now comparing medians, and that
this test is -sided.</p>
<p>You can stop here, or you can go on and note that most of the
males have a handspan bigger than the median, and most of the
females have a handspan smaller than the median, so that males
have on average a larger handspan. But you have to make the case
that males have a larger handspan; you cannot just assert this
from the P-value.</p>
<p>A more formal way to do this is to make the same observation as
above, then note that this is “on the correct side” (for males
to have a larger handspan), and thus that you can halve the
P-value, and conclude that males’ handspans are indeed larger in
terms of median.</p>
<p>Extra: you are probably expecting a confidence interval now for
the difference in medians. I haven’t talked about that in lecture, because the ideas are a bit trickier than they were for the confidence interval for the sign test. The sign test could be used for testing any median, so we could try a bunch of medians and see whether each one was rejected or not. The problem with Mood’s median test is that it only tests that the medians are <em>the same</em>. If you could easily test that the difference in medians was 3, say, you would know whether 3 was inside or outside the confidence interval for the difference in medians.</p>
<p>What were the actual sample medians, anyway?</p>

<p>Dataframe <code>d</code> has a new column <code>x</code> that is the handspan plus 2.5 inches for females, and the unchanged handspan for males. So the median of <code>x</code> should be the same for males and females:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb89"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb89-1" title="1">d <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">group_by</span>(sex) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb89-2" title="2"><span class="kw">summarize</span>(<span class="dt">med_x =</span> <span class="kw">median</span>(x))</a></code></pre></div>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sex"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["med_x"],"name":[2],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"F","2":"22.5"},{"1":"M","2":"22.5"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>and also the medians of <code>x</code> cannot possibly be significantly different:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb90"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb90-1" title="1"><span class="kw">median_test</span>(d, x, sex)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## $table
##      above
## group above below
##     F    46    36
##     M    41    35
## 
## $test
##        what      value
## 1 statistic 0.07369901
## 2        df 1.00000000
## 3   P-value 0.78602526</code></pre>
<p>Quite a lot of the values of <code>x</code> are exactly equal to the overall median (and are discarded), so the P-value is not exactly 1 as you would expect. But it is definitely not significant, and so a difference of 2.5 inches smaller for females is going to be in a confidence interval for the difference in medians.</p>
<p>The strategy now is to try shifting the female handspans by different amounts, run Mood’s median test for each one, and see which shifts are not rejected. These are the ones for which that difference in medians would be in the confidence interval. Before we get to that, though, I want to simplify the procedure we have, so that it is easier to run it lots of times. First, let’s get just the P-value out of the median test:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb92"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb92-1" title="1">d<span class="fl">.1</span> &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">median_test</span>(d, x, sex)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb92-2" title="2">d<span class="fl">.1</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">pluck</span>(<span class="st">&quot;test&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;value&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.7860253</code></pre>
<p>That’s the P-value. <code>pluck</code> pulls individual things out of bigger things. The variable I called <code>d.1</code> has two things in it. The one called <code>table</code> has the numbers of data values above and below the overall median; the one called <code>test</code> has the test statistic and P-value in it. <code>test</code> is a dataframe; inside <em>that</em> is a column called <code>what</code> and a column called <code>value</code> with the number we want in it, and we want the third thing in that (the other two are the chi-squared test statistic and its degrees of freedom). Hence the <code>pluck</code> statement got the right thing.</p>
<p>Let’s think strategy: we want to shift the female handspans by a bunch of different amounts, run the test on each one, and get the P-value each time. When you’re running a big for-each like this, you want the thing you do each time to be as simple as possible. So let’s write a function that takes the shift as input, works out the new <code>x</code>, runs the test, and returns the P-value. We have all the ingredients, so it’s a matter of putting them together:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb94"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb94-1" title="1">shift_pval &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="cf">function</span>(shift) {</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb94-2" title="2">span <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> <span class="kw">ifelse</span>(sex <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> &quot;F&quot;</span>, handspan <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span>shift, handspan)) -&gt;<span class="st"> </span>d</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb94-3" title="3">d<span class="fl">.1</span> &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">median_test</span>(d, x, sex)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb94-4" title="4">d<span class="fl">.1</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">pluck</span>(<span class="st">&quot;test&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;value&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb94-5" title="5">}</a></code></pre></div>
<p>In the function, the <code>shift</code> is input. The first line computes the handspans shifted by the input amount, whatever it is; the second line runs the median test on the shifted data; the last line pulls out, and returns, the P-value.</p>
<p>I am being a little sloppy here (but R is letting me get away with it): the function is also using a dataframe called <code>span</code>, which is the one we read in from the file earlier. That <em>was not input to the function</em>, so, if you have experience with other programming languages, you might be wondering whether that is “in the scope” of inside the function: that is, whether R will know about it. R does; anything the function needs that is not part of the input, it will take from your workspace. This is, you might imagine, dangerous; if the input to your function is called, say, <code>x</code>, you might easily have an <code>x</code> lying around in your workspace from some other analysis that has nothing to do with the <code>x</code> you want as the input to your function. The safe way to do it, and what I should have done, is to have <code>span</code> be input to my function as well. However, that clutters up the discussion below, so we’ll leave things as I did them here.</p>
<p>Let’s test this on a shift of 2.5 inches, and on the original data (a shift of zero):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb95"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb95-1" title="1"><span class="kw">shift_pval</span>(<span class="fl">2.5</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.7860253</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb97"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb97-1" title="1"><span class="kw">shift_pval</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 2.66404e-19</code></pre>
<p>Those are the same P-values we got before, so good.</p>
<p>Now, let’s get a bunch of shifts, say from 0 to 5 in steps of 0.5:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb99"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb99-1" title="1"><span class="kw">tibble</span>(<span class="dt">shift =</span> <span class="kw">seq</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="fl">0.5</span>))</a></code></pre></div>

<p>The confidence interval goes from 2 inches to 2.5 inches on this scale. I checked and it goes up to 3 really, except that 3 itself is outside the interval. So let’s call it 2 to 3 inches. This means that the median female handspan is between 2 and 3 inches <em>smaller</em> than the median male handspan, because we had to shift the female handspans up by that much to make them not significantly different.</p>
<p>You, of course, would do just the last pipeline; I showed you the steps so you could see what was going on.</p>
<p>The final observation is that this interval is a long way from containing zero, because the P-value was so tiny.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-interval looks in comparison (two-sided, because we want the confidence interval):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb102"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb102-1" title="1"><span class="kw">t.test</span>(handspan<span class="op">~</span>sex, <span class="dt">data =</span> span)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  handspan by sex
## t = -10.871, df = 187.92, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -3.001496 -2.079466
## sample estimates:
## mean in group F mean in group M 
##        20.01699        22.55747</code></pre>
<p>Almost exactly the same (except that F is before M). So it made no difference at all whether we did a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test or a Mood’s median test, as the bootstrapped sampling distribution suggested.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
