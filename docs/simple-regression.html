<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.1</span> Rainfall in California</h2>
<p>The data in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/calirain.txt">link</a> are
rainfall and other measurements for 30 weather stations in
California. Our aim is to understand how well the annual rainfall at
these stations (measured in inches) can be predicted from the other
measurements, which are the altitude (in feet above sea level), the
latitude (degrees north of the equator) and the distance from the
coast (in miles).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Read the data into R. You’ll have to be careful here, since the
values are space-delimited, but sometimes by more than one space, to
make the columns line up. <code>read_table2</code>, with filename or
url, will read it in.
One of the variables
is called <code>rainfall</code>, so as long as you <em>do not</em> call
the data frame that, you should be safe.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a boxplot of the rainfall figures, and explain why the
values are reasonable. (A rainfall cannot be negative, and it is
unusual for a annual rainfall to exceed 60 inches.) A
<code>ggplot</code> boxplot needs <em>something</em> on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis: the
number 1 will do.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot <code>rainfall</code> against each of the other quantitative
variables (that is, not <code>station</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the relationship of each other variable with
<code>rainfall</code>.
Justify the assertion that <code>latitude</code> seems most strongly
related with <code>rainfall</code>. Is that relationship positive or negative? linear? Explain
briefly.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit a regression with <code>rainfall</code> as the response
variable, and <code>latitude</code> as your explanatory variable. What
are the intercept, slope and R-squared values? Is there a
<em>significant</em> relationship between <code>rainfall</code> and your
explanatory variable? What does that mean?</p></li>
<li><p>Fit a multiple regression predicting <code>rainfall</code> from
all three of the other (quantitative) variables. Display the
results. Comment is coming up later.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the R-squared for the regression of the last part?
How does that compare with the R-squared of your regression in part (e)?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you conclude about the importance of the variables
that you did <em>not</em> include in your model in
(e)? Explain briefly.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a suitable hypothesis test that the variables
<code>altitude</code> and <code>fromcoast</code> significantly improve the
prediction of <code>rainfall</code> over the use of <code>latitude</code>
alone. What do you conclude?</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.2</span> Carbon monoxide in cigarettes</h2>
<p>The (US) Federal Trade Commission assesses cigarettes
according to their tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide contents. In a
particular year, 25 brands were assessed. For each brand, the tar,
nicotine and carbon monoxide (all in milligrams) were measured, along
with the weight in grams. Our aim is to predict carbon monoxide from
any or all of the other variables. The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ftccigar.txt">link</a>. These are
aligned by column (except for the variable names), with more than one
space between each column of data.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Read the data into R, and check that you have 25 observations
and 4 variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Run a regression to predict carbon monoxide from the other
variables, and obtain a summary of the output.</p></li>
<li><p>Which one of your explanatory variables would you
remove from this regression? Explain (very) briefly. Go ahead and
fit the regression without it, and describe how the change in
R-squared from the regression in (b) was entirely predictable.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit a regression predicting carbon monoxide from
<code>nicotine</code> <em>only</em>, and display the summary.</p></li>
<li><p><code>nicotine</code> was far from being significant in the model
of (c), and yet in the model of
(d), it was <em>strongly</em> significant, and the
R-squared value of (d) was almost as high as that
of (c). What does this say about the importance of
<code>nicotine</code> as an explanatory variable? Explain, as briefly as
you can manage.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a “pairs plot”: that is, scatter plots between all
pairs of variables. This can be done by feeding the whole data frame
into <code>plot</code>.

part? Explain briefly (or “at length” if that’s how it comes
out).</p></li>

<p>Is there a relationship between the number

associative memory? To find out, a 2012 study measured both of these
variables for a sample of 40 students at City University in London

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.5</span> Endogenous nitrogen excretion in carp</h2>
<p>A paper in Fisheries Science reported on variables that
affect “endogenous nitrogen excretion” or ENE in carp raised in
Japan. A number of carp were divided into groups based on body weight,
and each group was placed in a different tank. The mean body weight of
the carp placed in each tank was recorded. The carp were then fed a
protein-free diet three times daily for a period of 20 days. At the
end of the experiment, the amount of ENE in each tank was measured, in
milligrams of total fish body weight per day. (Thus it should not
matter that some of the tanks had more fish than others, because the
scaling is done properly.)</p>

Extra: What stations have those extreme values? Should you wish to find out:</p>

<p>This is a place right on the Pacific coast, almost up into Oregon (it’s almost
the northernmost of all the stations). So it makes sense that it would
have a high rainfall, if anywhere does. (If you know anything about
rainy places, you’ll probably think of Vancouver and Seattle, in the
Pacific Northwest.) Here it is:

<p>The name of the station is a clue: this one is in the desert. So you’d
expect very little rain. Its altitude is <em>negative</em>, so it’s
actually <em>below</em> sea level. This is correct. Here is where it is:

<p>You can add a smooth trend to these if you want. Up to you. Just the

<p>Here is a funky way to get all three plots in one shot:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-907-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This always seems extraordinarily strange if you haven’t run into it
before. The strategy is to put <em>all</em> the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variables you want
to plot into <em>one</em> column and then plot your <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> against the
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-column. Thus: make a column of all the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s glued
together, labelled by which <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> they are, then plot <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
but make a different sub-plot or “facet” for each different
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-name. The last thing is that each <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is measured on a different
scale, and unless we take steps, all the sub-plots will have the
<em>same</em> scale on each axis, which we don’t want.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I like how it came out, with three very tall
plots. <code>facet_wrap</code> can also take an <code>nrow</code> or an
<code>ncol</code>, which tells it how many rows or columns to use for the
display. Here, for example, two columns because I thought three was
too many:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-908-1.png" width="672"  /></p>

<p>Let’s look at the three variables in turn:</p>

a higher rainfall. I’d call this trend linear (or, not obviously
curved), though the two most northerly stations have one higher
and one much lower rainfall than you’d expect.</p></li>
<li><p><code>fromcoast</code>: this is a weak downward trend, though
the trend is spoiled by those three stations about 150 miles

<p>Here, the intercept is 23.8, the slope is <span class="math inline">\(-0.05\)</span> and R-squared is a
dismal 0.04 (4%). This is a way of seeing that this relationship is
really weak, and it doesn’t even have a curve to the trend or anything
that would compensate for this. I looked at the scatterplot again and
saw that if it were not for the point bottom right which is furthest
from the coast and has almost no rainfall, there would be almost no
trend at all. The slope here is not significantly different from zero,
with a P-value of 0.265.</p>

<p>Both variables <code>altitude</code> and <code>fromcoast</code> are
significant in this regression, so they have <em>something to add</em> over and above <code>latitude</code> when it comes to
predicting rainfall, even though (and this seems odd) they have no
apparent relationship with <code>rainfall</code> on their own.
Another way to say this is that the three variables work together
as a team to predict rainfall, and together they do much better
than any one of them can do by themselves.<br />
This also goes to show that the scatterplots we began

<p>This calls for <code>anova</code>. Feed this two fitted models,

<p>This can be shorter than describing the whole model again, as you do
with the <code>cigs.2</code> version of <code>lm</code>. The syntax is that
you first specify a “base” fitted model object that you’re going to
update. Because the model <code>cigs.1</code> contains all the information
about the kind of model it is, and which data frame the data come
from, R already knows that this is a linear
multiple regression and which <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s it contains. The second thing to describe is the change from
the “base”. In this case, we want to use the same response variable
and all the same explanatory variables that we had before, except for
<code>weight</code>. This is specified by a special kind of model formula
where <code>.</code> means “whatever was there before”: in English,
“same response and same explanatories except take out <code>weight</code>”.</p>

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><code>nicotine</code> was far from being significant in the model
of (c), and yet in the model of
(d), it was <em>strongly</em> significant, and the
R-squared value of (d) was almost as high as that
of (c). What does this say about the importance of
<code>nicotine</code> as an explanatory variable? Explain, as briefly as
you can manage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>What this says is that you <em>cannot</em> say anything about the
“importance” of <code>nicotine</code> without also describing the
context that you’re talking about. <em>By itself</em>,
<code>nicotine</code> is important, but , <code>nicotine</code> is not
important: precisely, it now has nothing to add over and above
the predictive value that <code>tar</code> has. You might guess that
this is because <code>tar</code> and <code>nicotine</code> are
“saying the same thing” in some fashion.
We’ll explore that in a moment.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

Do you see any strong relationships that do
<em>not</em> include <code>co</code>? Does that shed any light on the last
part? Explain briefly (or “at length” if that’s how it comes
out).</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Plot the entire data frame:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1279"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1279-1" title="1"><span class="kw">plot</span>(cigs)</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-919-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>We’re supposed to ignore <code>co</code>, but I comment that strong
relationships between <code>co</code> and <em>both</em> of <code>tar</code> and
<code>nicotine</code> show up here, along with <code>weight</code> being
at most weakly related to anything else.</p>
<p>That leaves the relationship of <code>tar</code> and <code>nicotine</code>
with each other. That also looks like a strong linear trend. When you
have correlations between explanatory variables, it is called
“multicollinearity”.</p>
<p>Having correlated <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s is
trouble. Here is where we find out why. The problem is that when
<code>co</code> is large, <code>nicotine</code> is large, and a large value of
<code>tar</code> will come along with it. So we don’t know whether a large
value of <code>co</code> is caused by a large value of <code>tar</code> or a
large value of <code>nicotine</code>: there is no way to separate out
their effects because in effect they are “glued together”.</p>
<p>You might know of this effect (in an experimental design context) as
“confounding”: the effect of <code>tar</code> on <code>co</code> is
confounded with the effect of <code>nicotine</code> on <code>co</code>, and
you can’t tell which one deserves the credit for predicting <code>co</code>.</p>
<p>If you were able to design an experiment here, you could (in
principle) manufacture a bunch of cigarettes with high tar; some of
them would have high nicotine and some would have low. Likewise for
low tar. Then the
correlation between <code>nicotine</code> and <code>tar</code> would go away,
their effects on <code>co</code> would no longer be confounded, and you
could see unambiguously which one of the variables deserves credit for
predicting <code>co</code>. Or maybe it depends on both, genuinely, but at
least then you’d know.</p>
<p>We, however, have an observational study, so we have to make do with
the data we have. Confounding is one of the risks we take when we work
with observational data.</p>
<p>This was a “base graphics” plot. There is a way of doing a
<code>ggplot</code>-style “pairs plot”, as this is called, thus:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1280"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1280-1" title="1"><span class="kw">library</span>(GGally)</a></code></pre></div>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-920-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>As ever, <code>install.packages</code> first, in the likely event that you
don’t have this package installed yet. Once you do, though, I think
this is a nicer way to get a pairs plot.</p>
<p>This plot is a bit more sophisticated: instead of just having the
scatterplots of the pairs of variables in the row and column, it uses
the diagonal to show a “kernel density” (a smoothed-out histogram),
and upper-right it shows the correlation between each pair of
variables. The three correlations between <code>co</code>, <code>tar</code>
and <code>nicotine</code> are clearly the highest.</p>
<p>If you want only some of the columns to appear in your pairs plot,
<code>select</code> them first, and then pass that data frame into
<code>ggpairs</code>. Here, we found that <code>weight</code> was not
correlated with anything much, so we can take it out and then make a
pairs plot of the other variables:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1283"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1283-1" title="1">cigs <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">select</span>(<span class="op">-</span>weight) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">ggpairs</span>(<span class="dt">progress =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-921-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The three correlations that remain are all very high, which is

<li>(A one-mark question.) Would you say, on the evidence so
far, that the regression fits well or badly? Explain (very)
briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>R-squared of 0.97 (97%) is very high, so I’d say this
regression fits very well. That’s all.
I said “on the evidence so far” to dissuade you from
overthinking this, or thinking that you needed to produce
some more evidence. That, plus the fact that this was only
one mark.</p>

<li>It seems reasonable that an older boy should have a
greater oxygen uptake, all else being equal. Is this supported
by your output? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>If an older boy has greater oxygen uptake (the “all else equal” was a hint),
the slope of <code>age</code> should be
positive. It is not: it is <span class="math inline">\(-0.035\)</span>, so it is suggesting
(all else equal) that a greater age goes with a
<em>smaller</em> oxygen uptake.
The reason why this happens (which you didn’t need, but
you can include it if you like) is that <code>age</code> has a
non-small P-value of 0.07, so that the <code>age</code> slope
is not significantly different from zero. With all the
other variables, <code>age</code> has nothing to <em>add</em>
over and above them, and we could therefore remove it.</p>

<li>It seems reasonable that a boy with larger weight

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Look at the P-value for <code>weight</code>. This is 0.14,
not small, and so a boy with larger weight does not have
a significantly larger oxygen uptake, all else
equal. (The slope for <code>weight</code> is not
significantly different from zero either.)

<p>This P-value of 0.123 is not small, so we do not reject the null
hypothesis. There is not a significant difference in fit between the
two models. Therefore, we should go with the smaller model
<code>boys.2</code> because it is simpler.</p>
<p>That drop in R-squared from 97% to 91% was, it turns out, <em>not</em>
significant: the three extra variables
could have produced a change in R-squared like that,
<em>even if they were worthless</em>.

<p>If you have learned about “adjusted R-squared”, you might recall
that this is supposed to go down <em>only</em> if the variables you took
out should not have been taken out. But adjusted R-squared goes down
here as well, from 94% to 89% (not quite as much, therefore). What
happens is that adjusted R-squared is rather more relaxed about
keeping variables than the <code>anova</code> <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test is; if we had used
an <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of something like 0.10, the decision between the two

<p>The correlations with <code>age</code> are all on the low side, but all
the other correlations are high, not just between <code>uptake</code> and the
other variables, but between the explanatory variables as well.</p>
<p>Why is this helpful in understanding what’s going on? Well, imagine a
boy with large height (a tall one). The regression <code>boys.2</code>
says that this alone is enough to predict that such a boy’s oxygen
uptake is likely to be large, since the slope is positive. But the
correlations tell you more: a boy with large height is also (somewhat)
likely to be older (have large age), heavier (large weight) and to have
larger <code>chest</code> cavity. So oxygen uptake does depend on those other
variables as well, but once you know <code>height</code> you can make a
good guess at their values; you don’t need to know them.</p>
<p>Further remarks: <code>age</code> has a low correlation with
<code>uptake</code>, so its non-significance earlier appears to be
“real”: it really does have nothing extra to say, because the other
variables have a stronger link with <code>uptake</code> than
<code>age</code>. Height, however, seems to be the best way of relating
oxygen uptake to any of the other variables. I think the suppositions
from earlier about relating oxygen uptake to “bigness”
<label for="tufte-mn-110" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-110" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">This is not, I don’t think, a real word, but I mean size emphasizing how big a boy is generally, rather than how small.</span> in some sense
are actually sound, but age and weight and <code>chest</code> capture
“bigness” worse than height does. Later, when you learn about
Principal Components, you will see that the first principal component,
the one that best captures how the variables vary together, is often
“bigness” in some sense.</p>
<p>Another way to think about these things is via pairwise
scatterplots. The nicest way to produce these is via <code>ggpairs</code>
from package <code>GGally</code>:</p>

<p>A final remark: with five variables, we really ought to have more than
ten observations (something like 50 would be better). But with more
observations and the same correlation structure, the same issues would
come up again, so the question would not be materially changed.</p>

“moderate”, you ought to say what makes you think that: for
example, that the people with a lot of Facebook friends also
tend to have a higher grey matter density. I can live with a
reasonably-justified “moderate”.)
The reason I said not to get taken in by the shape of the smooth
trend is that this has a “wiggle” in it: it goes down again
briefly in the middle. But this is likely a quirk of the data,

<li>Is the slope of your regression line significantly
different from zero? What does that mean, in the context of the

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The P-value of the slope is 0.005, which is less than
0.05. Therefore the slope <em>is</em> significantly different from
zero. That means that the number of Facebook friends really does
depend on the grey matter density, for the whole population of
interest and not just the 40 students observed here (that were a
sample from that population). I don’t mind so much what you
think the population is, but it needs to be clear that the
relationship applies to a population.
Another way to approach this is to say that you would expect
this relationship to show up again in another similar
experiment. That also works, because it gets at the idea of
reproducibility.</p>

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Are you surprised by the results of
parts (b) and (d)? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I <em>am</em> surprised, because I thought the trend on the
scatterplot was so weak that there would not be a significant
slope. I guess there was enough of an upward trend to be
significant, and with <span class="math inline">\(n=40\)</span> observations we were able to get a
significant slope out of that scatterplot. With this many
observations, even a weak correlation can be significantly
nonzero.
You can be surprised or not, but you need to have some kind of
consideration of the strength of the trend on the scatterplot as
against the significance of the slope. For example, if you
decided that the trend was “moderate” in strength, you would
be justified in being less surprised than I was.
Here, there is the usual issue that we have proved that the
slope is not zero (that the relationship is not flat), but we
may not have a very clear idea of what the slope actually
<em>is</em>. There are a couple of ways to get a confidence
interval. The obvious one is to use R as a calculator and go up
and down twice its standard error (to get a rough idea):</p>

<p>The confidence interval for the slope goes from about 27 to about
138. That is to say, a one-unit increase in grey matter density goes
with an increase in Facebook friends of this much. This is not
especially insightful: it’s bigger than zero (the test was
significant), but other than that, it could be almost
anything. <em>This</em> is where the weakness of the trend comes back to
bite us. With this much scatter in our data, we need a <em>much</em>
larger sample size to estimate accurately how big an effect grey

<p>There is some “magic” here, since the fitted model object is not
actually a data frame, but it works this way.
That looks to me like a completely random scatter of
points. Thus, I am completely happy with the straight-line regression
that we fitted, and I see no need to improve it.</p>
<p>(You should make two points here: one, describe what you see, and two,
what it implies about whether or not your regression is satisfactory.)</p>
<p>Compare that residual plot with this one:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1313"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1313-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(fb<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span></a>

<p>Now, why did I try adding a smooth trend, and why is it not
necessarily a good idea? The idea of a residual plot is that there
should be no trend, and so the smooth trend curve ought to go straight
across. The problem is that it will tend to wiggle, just by chance, as
here: it looks as if it goes up and down before flattening out. But if
you look at the points, <em>they</em> are all over the place, not close
to the smooth trend at all. So the smooth trend is rather
deceiving. Or, to put it another way, to indicate a real problem, the
smooth trend would have to be a <em>lot</em> farther from flat than this
one is. I’d call this one basically flat.</p>

<p>A paper in Fisheries Science reported on variables that
affect “endogenous nitrogen excretion” or ENE in carp raised in
Japan. A number of carp were divided into groups based on body weight,
and each group was placed in a different tank. The mean body weight of
the carp placed in each tank was recorded. The carp were then fed a
protein-free diet three times daily for a period of 20 days. At the
end of the experiment, the amount of ENE in each tank was measured, in
milligrams of total fish body weight per day. (Thus it should not
matter that some of the tanks had more fish than others, because the
scaling is done properly.)</p>

I would think about

<p>so now you see what <code>carp.2a</code> has in it, and then:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1327"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1327-1" title="1">g &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(carp<span class="fl">.2</span>a, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> bodyweight, <span class="dt">y =</span> .fitted)) <span class="op">+</span></a>

<p>This is easier coding: there are only two non-standard things. The
first is that the fitted-value lines should be a distinct colour like
blue so that you can tell them from the data points. The second thing
is that for the second <code>geom_point</code>, the one that plots the data,
the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate <code>bodyweight</code> is correct so that we don’t
have to change that; we only have to change the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinate, which
is <code>ENE</code>. The plot is this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1328"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1328-1" title="1">g</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-944-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Concerning interpretation, you have a number of possibilities
here. The simplest is that the points in the middle are above the
curve, and the points at the ends are below. (That is, negative
residuals at the ends, and positive ones in the middle, which gives
you a hint for the next part.) Another is that the parabola curve
fails to capture the <em>shape</em> of the relationship; for example, I
see nothing much in the data suggesting that the relationship should go
back up, and even given that, the fitted curve doesn’t go especially
near any of the points.</p>
<p>I was thinking that the data should be fit better by something like
the left half of an upward-opening parabola, but I guess the curvature
on the left half of the plot suggests that it needs most of the left
half of the parabola just to cover the left half of the plot.</p>
<p>The moral of the story, as we see in the next part, is that the
parabola is the wrong curve for the job.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Obtain a residual plot for the parabola model. Do you see
any problems with it? (If you do, I’m not asking you to do anything
about them in this question, but I will.)</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<p>The same idea as before for the other residual plot. Use the
fitted model object <code>carp.2</code> as your data frame for the
<code>ggplot</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1329"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1329-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(carp<span class="fl">.2</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-945-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I think this is <em>still</em> a curve (or, it goes down and then
sharply up at the end). Either way, there is still a pattern.</p>
<p>That was all I needed, but as to what this means: our parabola was a
curve all right, but it appears not to be the right <em>kind</em> of
curve. I think the original data looks more like a hyperbola (a curve
like <span class="math inline">\(y=1/x\)</span>) than a parabola, in that it seems to decrease fast and
then gradually to a limit, and <em>that</em> suggests, as in the class
example, that we should try an asymptote model. Note how I specify it,
with the <code>I()</code> thing again, since <code>/</code> has a special meaning
to <code>lm</code> in the same way that
<code>^</code> does:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1330"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1330-1" title="1">carp<span class="fl">.3</span> &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">lm</span>(ENE <span class="op">~</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">I</span>(<span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">/</span><span class="st"> </span>bodyweight), <span class="dt">data =</span> carp)</a>

<p>That fits <em>extraordinarily</em> well, with an R-squared up near
98%. The intercept is the asymptote, which suggests a (lower) limit
of about 5.2 for <code>ENE</code> (in the limit for large bodyweight). We
would have to ask the fisheries scientist whether this kind of thing
is a reasonable biological mechanism. It says that a carp always has
some ENE, no matter how big it gets, but a smaller carp will have a
lot more.</p>
<p>Does the fitted value plot look reasonable now? This is <code>augment</code> again since the fitted values and observed data come from different data frames:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/augment2-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I’d say that does a really nice job of fitting the data. But it would
be nice to have a few more tanks with large-bodyweight fish, to
convince us that we have the shape of the trend right.</p>
<p>And, as ever, the residual plot. That’s a lot easier than the plot we
just did:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1333"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1333-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(carp<span class="fl">.3</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-947-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>All in all, that looks pretty good (and certainly a vast improvement
over the ones you got before).</p>
<p>When you write up your report, you can make it flow better by writing

<p>A person working in any field cannot have a negative number of years
of experience, and cannot have more than about 40 years of experience
(or else they would have retired). Our experience numbers fit
that. Salaries had better be five or six figures, and salaries for
social workers are not generally all that high, so these figures look
reasonable.</p>

<p>This gets the minimum and maximum of all the variables. I would have
liked them arranged in a nice rectangle (<code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
as rows, the variables as columns), but that’s not how this came out.</p>
<p>The code so far uses <code>across</code>. This means to do something across multiple columns. In this case, we want to do the calculation on <em>all</em> the columns, so we use the select-helper <code>everything</code>. You can use any of the other select-helpers like <code>starts_with</code>, or you could do something like <code>where(is.numeric)</code> to do your summaries only on the quantitative columns (which would also work here). The dots inside <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> mean “the variable we are looking at at the moment”, and the squiggles before <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> mean “calculate”, so you read the above code as “for each column, work out the smallest and largest value of it”.</p>
<p>What, you want a nice rectangle? This is a pivot-longer, but the fancy version because the column names encode two kinds of things, a variable and a statistic:</p>

<p>Note the strategy: make it longer first, then figure out what to do next. This is different from <code>rowwise</code>; in fact, we are working “columnwise”, doing something for each column, no matter how many there are. My go-to for this stuff is <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another way to work is with the five-number summary. This gives a more nuanced picture of the data values we have.
<label for="tufte-mn-115" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-115" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">This might be overkill at this point, since we really only care about whether our data values are reasonable, and often just looking at the highest and lowest values will tell us that.</span></p>
<p>The base-R five-number summary looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1342"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1342-1" title="1">qq &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">quantile</span>(soc<span class="op">$</span>experience)</a>

<pre><code>##    0%   25%   50%   75%  100% 
##  1.00 13.50 20.00 24.75 28.00</code></pre>
<p>This is what’s known as a “named vector”. The numbers on the bottom are the summaries themselves, and the names above say which percentile you are looking at. Unfortunately, the <code>tidyverse</code> doesn’t like names, so modelling after the above doesn’t quite work:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1344"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1344-1" title="1">soc <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></a>

<p>The slope is (significantly) positive, which squares with our guess
(more experience goes with greater salary), and also the upward trend
on the scatterplot. The value of the slope is about 2,000; this means
that one more year of experience goes with about a $2,000 increase in
salary.</p>

<li>Obtain and plot the residuals against the fitted values. What
problem do you see?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this with <code>ggplot</code> is to plot the
<em>regression object</em> (even though it is not actually a data
frame), and plot the <code>.fitted</code> and <code>.resid</code>
columns in it, not forgetting the initial dots:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1349"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1349-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(soc<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-958-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I see a “fanning-out”: the residuals are getting bigger <em>in size</em>
(further away from zero) as the fitted values get bigger. That
is, when the (estimated) salary gets larger, it also gets more
variable.</p>
<p>Fanning-out is sometimes hard to see. What you can do if you suspect
that it might have happened is to plot the <em>absolute value</em> of
the residuals against the fitted values. The absolute value is the
residual without its plus or minus sign, so if the residuals are
getting bigger in size, their absolute values are getting bigger. That
would look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1350"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1350-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(soc<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="kw">abs</span>(.resid))) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>()</a></code></pre></div>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-959-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I added a smooth trend to this to help us judge whether the
absolute-value-residuals are getting bigger as the fitted values get
bigger. It looks to me as if the overall trend is an increasing one,
apart from those few small fitted values that have larger-sized
residuals. Don’t get thrown off by the kinks in the smooth trend. Here
is a smoother version:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-960-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The larger fitted values, according to this, have residuals larger in size.</p>
<p>The thing that controls the smoothness of the smooth trend is the
value of <code>span</code> in <code>geom_smooth</code>. The default is
0.75. The larger the value you use, the smoother the trend; the
smaller, the more wiggly. I’m inclined to think that the default value
is a bit too small. Possibly this value is too big, but it shows you
the idea.</p>

<p>That one looks like <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=0\)</span> or log. You could probably also
justify fourth root (power 0.25), but log is a very common
transformation, which people won’t need much persuasion to accept.</p>
<p>There’s one annoyance with <code>MASS</code>: it has a <code>select</code>
(which I have never used), and if you load <code>tidyverse</code> first
and <code>MASS</code> second, as I have done here, when you mean to run
the column-selection <code>select</code>, it will actually run the
<code>select</code> that comes from <code>MASS</code>, and give you an error
that you will have a terrible time debugging. That’s what that
“masked” message was when you loaded <code>MASS</code>. This is a great place to learn about the <code>conflicted</code> package. See <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/conflicted">here</a> for how it works. (Scroll down to under the list of files.)</p>
<p>If you want to insist on something like “the <code>select</code> that lives in <code>dplyr</code>”,
you can do that by saying
<code>dplyr::select</code>. But this is kind of cumbersome if you don’t
need to do it.</p>

<p>The second line is where the fun starts: <code>lm</code> wants the data
frame as a <code>data=</code> at the end. So, to specify a data frame in
something like <code>lm</code>, we have to use the special symbol
<code>.</code>, which is another way to say
“the data frame that came out of the previous step”.</p>
<p>Got that? All right. The last line is a piece of cake in
comparison. Normally <code>summary</code> would require a data frame or a
fitted model object, but the second line produces one (a fitted model
object) as output, which goes into <code>summary</code> as the first
(and only) thing, so all is good and we get the regression output.</p>
<p>What we lose by doing this is that if we need something later from this
fitted model object, we are out of luck since we didn’t save
it. That’s why I created <code>soc.2</code> and <code>soc.3</code> above.</p>

<p>That, to my mind, is a horizontal band of points, so I would say yes,
I have solved the fanning out.</p>
<p>One concern I have about the residuals is that there seem to be a
couple of very negative values: that is, are the residuals normally
distributed as they should be? Well, that’s easy enough to check:</p>

and the top few values are a bit bunched up (that curve at the top).
It is really not bad, though, so I am making the call that I don’t
think I needed to worry.
Note that the transformation we found here is the same as the
log-salary used by the management consultants in the
backward-elimination question, and with the same effect: an extra year
of experience goes with a <em>percent</em> increase in salary.</p>
<p>What increase? Well, the slope is about 0.05, so adding a year of
experience is predicted to increase log-salary by 0.05, or to
multiply actual salary by</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.19</span> Predicting volume of wood in pine trees</h2>
<p>In forestry, the financial value of a tree
is the volume of wood that it contains. This is difficult to estimate
while the tree is still standing, but the diameter is easy to measure
with a tape measure (to measure the circumference) and a calculation
involving <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, assuming that the cross-section of the tree is at
least approximately circular. The standard measurement is
“diameter at breast height”
(that is, at the height of a human breast or
chest), defined as being 4.5 feet above the ground.</p>
<p>Several pine trees had their diameter measured shortly before being
cut down, and for each tree, the volume of wood was recorded. The data
are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/pinetrees.txt">link</a>. The
diameter is in inches and the volume is in cubic inches. Is it
possible to predict the volume of wood from the diameter?</p>

<p>No clues this time. You need to recognize that you have two

<p>The word “relationship” offers a clue that a scatterplot would
have been a good idea, if you hadn’t realized by now.
I am guided by “form, direction, strength” in looking at a scatterplot:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Form: it is an apparently linear relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Direction: it is an upward trend: that is, a tree with a larger diameter also has a larger volume of wood. (This is not very surprising.)</p></li>
<li><p>Strength: I’d call this a strong (or moderate-to-strong) relationship. (We’ll see in a minute what the R-squared is.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to be as formal as this, but you <em>do</em> need
to get at the idea that it is an upward trend, apparently
linear, and at least fairly strong.

something.</p>
<p>I don’t think you can justify a curve or a trend, because
the residuals on the left are both positive and negative.</p>
<p>My feeling is that the residuals on the right are close to 0 because
these points have noticeably larger diameter than the others, and they
are <em>influential</em> points in the regression that will pull the

zero. But I am happy with either of the points made in the paragraph

<li>What would you guess would be the volume of a tree of

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Logically, a tree that has diameter zero is a non-existent tree,
so its volume should be zero as well.
In the regression, the quantity that says what volume is when
diameter is zero is the <em>intercept</em>. Here the intercept is
<span class="math inline">\(-192\)</span>, which is definitely not zero. In fact, if you look at
the P-value, the intercept is significantly <em>less</em> than
zero. Thus, the model makes no logical sense for trees of small
diameter. The smallest tree in the data set has diameter 18,
which is not really small, I suppose, but it is a little
disconcerting to have a model that makes no logical sense.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>According to

the volume of a cone is <span class="math inline">\(V=\pi r^2h/3\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the volume,

<p>This adds an intercept as well, which is fine (there are technical
difficulties around removing the intercept).</p>
<p>That’s as far as I wanted you to go, but (of course) I have a few
comments.</p>
<p>The intercept here is still negative, but not significantly different
from zero, which is a step forward. The R-squared for this regression
is very similar to that from our linear model (the one for which the
intercept made no sense). So, from that point of view, either model
predicts the data well. I should look at the residuals from this one:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1381"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1381-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(volume<span class="fl">.2</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-979-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I really don’t think there are any problems there.</p>
<p>Now, I said to assume that the trees are all of similar height. This
seems entirely questionable, since the trees vary quite a bit in
diameter, and you would guess that trees with bigger diameter would
also be taller. It seems more plausible that the same kind of trees
(pine trees in this case) would have the same “shape”, so that if
you knew the diameter you could <em>predict</em> the height, with
larger-diameter trees being taller. Except that we don’t have the
heights here, so we can’t build a model for that.</p>
<p>So I went looking in the literature. I found this paper:
<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5497/3d02d63428e3dfed6645acfdba874ad80822.pdf">link</a>. This
gives several models for relationships between volume, diameter and height. In
the formulas below, there is an implied “plus error” on the right,
and the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span> are parameters to be estimated.</p>
<p>For predicting height from diameter (equation 1 in paper):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[  h = \exp(\alpha_1+\alpha_2 d^{\alpha_3}) \]</span></p>
<p>For predicting volume from height and diameter (equation 6):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[  V = \alpha_1 d^{\alpha_2} h^{\alpha_3} \]</span></p>
<p>This is a take-off on our assumption that the trees were cone-shaped,
with cone-shaped trees having <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1=\pi/12\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2=2\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_3=1\)</span>. The paper uses different units, so <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span> is not
comparable, but <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_3\)</span> are (as estimated from the
data in the paper, which were for longleaf pine) quite close to 2 and
1.</p>
<p>Last, the actual relationship that helps us: predicting volume from
just diameter (equation 5):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[  V = \alpha_1 d^{\alpha_2}\]</span></p>
<p>This is a power law type of relationship. For example, if you were
willing to pretend that a tree was a cone with height proportional to
diameter (one way of getting at the idea of a bigger tree typically
being taller, instead of assuming constant height as we did), that
would imply <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2=3\)</span> here.</p>
<p>This is non-linear as it stands, but we can bash it into shape by taking
logs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\ln V = \ln \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \ln d
\]</span></p>
<p>so that log-volume has a linear relationship with log-diameter and we
can go ahead and estimate it:</p>

<p>The parameter that I called <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2\)</span> above is the slope of this
model, 3.13. This is a bit different from the figure in the paper,
which was 2.19. I think these are comparable even though the other
parameter is not (again, measurements in different units, plus, this
time we need to take the log of it). I think the “slopes” are
comparable because we haven’t estimated our slope all that accurately:</p>

<p>From 2.3 to 3.9. It is definitely not zero, but we are rather less
sure about what it is, and 2.19 is not completely implausible.</p>
<p>The R-squared here, though it is less than the other ones we
got, is still high. The residuals are these:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1386"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1386-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(volume<span class="fl">.3</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-982-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>which again seem to show no problems. The residuals are smaller in
size now because of the log transformation: the actual and predicted
log-volumes are smaller numbers than the actual and predicted volumes,
so the residuals are now closer to zero.</p>
<p>Does this model behave itself at zero? Well, roughly at least: if the
diameter is very small, its log is very negative, and the predicted
log-volume is also very negative (the slope is positive). So the
predicted actual volume will be close to zero. If you want to make
that mathematically rigorous, you can take limits, but that’s the
intuition. We can also do some predictions: set up a data frame that has a column called <code>diameter</code> with some diameters to predict for:</p>

<p>I almost got caught by forgetting the <code>list</code> on the definition of <code>glances</code>. I certainly need it, because the output from <code>glance</code> is a (one-row) dataframe, not a single number.</p>
<p>It works. You see the three R-squared values in the first column of numbers. The
third model is otherwise a lot different from the others because it
has a different response variable.</p>
<p>Other thoughts:</p>
<p>How might you measure or estimate the height of a
tree (other than by climbing it and dropping a tape measure down)? One
way, that works if the tree is fairly isolated, is to walk away from
its base. Periodically, you point at the top of the tree, and when the
angle between your arm and the ground reaches 45 degrees, you stop
walking. (If it’s greater than 45 degrees, you walk further away, and
if it’s less, you walk back towards the tree.) The distance between
you and the base of the tree is then equal to the height of the tree,
and if you have a long enough tape measure you can measure it.</p>
<p>The above works because the tangent of 45 degrees is 1. If you have a
device that will measure the actual angle,

I found one called Clinometer. See also <a href="https://gabrielhemery.com/how-to-calculate-tree-height-using-a-smartphone/">link</a>.</span>
you
can be any distance away from the tree, point the device at the top,
record the angle, and do some trigonometry to estimate the height of
the tree (to which you add the height of your eyes).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.20</span> Tortoise shells and eggs</h2>

<li>Is a curve better than a line for these data? Justify your
answer in two ways: by comparing a measure of fit, and by doing a
suitable test of significance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>An appropriate measure of fit is R-squared. For the straight line,
this is about 0.01, and for the regression with the squared term it
is about 0.43. This tells us that a straight line fits appallingly
badly, and that a curve fits a <em>lot</em> better.
This doesn’t do a test, though. For that, look at the slope of the
length-squared term in the second regression; in particular,
look at its P-value. This is 0.0045, which is small: the squared
term is necessary, and taking it out would be a mistake. The
relationship really is curved, and trying to describe it with a
straight line would be a big mistake.</p>

<li>Make a residual plot for the straight line model: that is, plot
the residuals against the fitted values.
Does this echo
your conclusions of the previous part? In what way? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Plot the things called <code>.fitted</code> and <code>.resid</code> from the
regression object, which is not a data frame but you can treat it as
if it is for this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1403"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1403-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(tortoises<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-992-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Up to you whether you put a smooth trend on it or not:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1404"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1404-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(tortoises<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> .fitted, <span class="dt">y =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1404-2" title="2"><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-993-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Looking at the plot, you see a curve, up and down. The most
negative residuals go with small or large fitted values; when the
fitted value is in the middle, the residual is usually positive. A
curve on the residual plot indicates a curve in the actual
relationship. We just found above that a curve does fit a lot
better, so this is all consistent.</p>
<p>Aside: the grey “envelope” is wide, so there is a lot of scatter on the
residual plot. The grey envelope almost contains zero all the way
across, so the evidence for a curve (or any other kind of trend) is
not all that strong, based on this plot. This is in great contrast to
the regression with length-squared, where the length-squared term is
<em>definitely</em> necessary.</p>
<p>That was all I wanted, but you can certainly look at other
plots. Normal quantile plot of the residuals:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1406"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1406-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(tortoises<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> .resid)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-994-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This is not the best: the low values are a bit too low, so that the
whole picture is (a little) skewed to the left.
<label for="tufte-mn-120" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-120" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">The very negative residuals are at the left and right of the residual plot; they are there because the relationship is a curve. If you were to look at the residuals from the model with length-squared, you probably wouldn’t see this.</span></p>
<p>Another plot you can make is to assess fan-out: you plot the
<em>absolute value</em>
<label for="tufte-mn-121" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-121" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">The value, but throw away the minus sign if it has one.</span> of the residuals against the fitted values. The idea
is that if there is fan-out, the absolute value of the residuals will
get bigger:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-995-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I put the smooth curve on as a kind of warning: it looks as if the
size of the residuals goes down and then up again as the fitted values
increase. But the width of the grey “envelope” and the general
scatter of the points suggests that there is really not much happening
here at all. On a plot of residuals, the grey envelope is really more
informative than the blue smooth trend. On this one, there is no
evidence of any fan-out (or fan-in).</p>

<p>The number of marks for this kind of thing has been decreasing through
the course, since by now you ought to have figured out how to do it
without looking it up.</p>
<p>There are 10 rows for the promised 10 roller-coasters, and there are
several columns: the drop for each roller-coaster and the duration of
its ride, as promised, as well as the name of each roller-coaster and the state
that it is in. (A lot of them seem to be in Ohio, for some reason that
I don’t know.) So this all looks good.</p>

<p>The last part, about the labels not overlapping, is an

<p>I think there are two good answers here: “yes” and “kind of”.
Supporting “yes” is the fact that the regression line does go
uphill, so that overall, or on average, roller-coasters with a
larger drop do tend to have a longer duration of ride as well.
Supporting “kind of” is the fact that, though the regression
line goes uphill, there are a lot of roller-coasters that are
some way off the trend, far from the regression line.
I am happy to go with either of those. I could also go with
“not really” and the same discussion that I attached to
“kind of”.</p>

<li>Find a roller-coaster that is unusual compared to the

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is an invitation to find a point that is a long way off the
line. I think the obvious choice is my first one below, but I
would take either of the others as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Nitro” is a long way above the line. That means it has
a long duration, relative to its drop. There are two other
roller-coasters that have a larger drop but not as long a
duration. In other words, this roller-coaster drops slowly,
presumably by doing a lot of twisting, loop-the-loop and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Beast” is a long way below the line, so it has a
short duration relative to its drop. It is actually the
shortest ride of all, but is only a bit below average in terms
of drop. This suggests that The Beast is one of those rides
that drops a long way quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>“Millennium Force” has the biggest drop of all, but a
shorter-than-average duration. This looks like another ride
with a big drop in it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A roller-coaster that is “unusual” will have a residual that
is large in size (either positive, like Nitro, or negative, like
the other two). I didn’t ask you to find the residuals, but if
you want to, <code>augment</code> from <code>broom</code> is the
smoothest way to go:</p>

<p><code>augment</code> produces a data frame (of the original data frame
with some new columns that come from the regression), so I can feed it
into a pipe to do things with it, like only displaying the columns I
want, and arranging them in order by absolute value of residual, so
that the roller-coasters further from the line come out first. This
identifies the three that we found above. The fourth one, “Ghost Rider”,
is like Nitro in that it takes a (relatively) long time to
fall not very far.
You can also put <code>augment</code> in the <em>middle</em> of a pipe. What
you may have to do then is supply the <em>original</em> data frame name

<p>I wanted to hang on to the roller-coaster names, so I added the data
frame name to <code>augment</code>. If you don’t (that is, you just put
<code>augment()</code> in the middle of a pipe), then <code>augment</code>
“attempts to reconstruct the data from the model”.
<label for="tufte-mn-124" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-124" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">A quote from the package vignette.</span> That means you wouldn’t get
<em>everything</em> from the original data frame; you would just get the
things that were in the regression. In this case, that means you would lose
the coaster names.</p>
<p>A technicality (but one that you should probably care about):
<code>augment</code> takes up to <em>two</em> inputs: a fitted model object

<h2><span class="header-section-number">16.22</span> Running and blood sugar</h2>
<p>A diabetic wants to know how aerobic exercise affects his
blood sugar. When his blood sugar reaches 170 (mg/dl), he goes out for
a run at a pace of 10 minutes per mile. He runs different distances on
different days. Each time he runs, he measures his blood sugar after
the run. (The preferred blood sugar level is between 80 and 120 on
this scale.) The data are in the file
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/runner.txt">link</a>. Our aim is
to predict blood sugar from distance.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>I’d say that this is about as linear as you could ever wish
for. Neither the pattern of points nor the smooth trend have any
kind of noticeable bend in them. (Observing a lack of curvature in
either the points or the smooth trend is enough.) The trend
is a linear one, so using a regression will be just fine. (If it

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>How would you <em>interpret</em> the slope? That is, what is
the slope, and what does that mean about blood sugar and running distance?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The slope is <span class="math inline">\(-25.37\)</span>. This means that for each additional mile run,
the runner’s blood sugar will decrease on average by about 25 units.</p>
<p>You can check this from the scatterplot. For example, from 2 to 3
miles, average blood sugar decreases from about 140 to about 115, a
drop of 25.</p>

<li>Is there a (statistically) significant relationship between

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Look at the P-value either on the <code>distance</code> line (for its
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test) or for the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-statistic on the bottom line. These are
the same: 0.000000023. (They will be the same any time there is
one <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-variable.) This P-value is <em>way</em> smaller than 0.05,
so there <em>is</em> a significant relationship between running distance
and blood sugar. This does not surprise me in the slightest,
because the trend on the scatterplot is <em>so</em> clear, there’s
no way it could have happened by chance if in fact there were no
relationship between running distance and blood sugar.</p>

<li>This diabetic is planning to go for a 3-mile run tomorrow

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is a prediction interval, in each case, since we are talking about
<em>individual</em> runs of 3 miles and 5 miles (not the mean blood
sugar after <em>all</em> runs of 3 miles, which is what a confidence
interval for the mean response would be).
The procedure is to set up a data frame with the two
<code>distance</code> values in it, and then feed that and the
regression object into <code>predict</code>, coming up in a moment.</p>

<p>Extra: both <code>cbind</code> and <code>data.frame</code> are “base R” ways of
combining a data frame with something else to make a new data
frame. They are not from the <code>tidyverse</code>. The
<code>tidyverse</code> way is via <code>tibble</code> or <code>bind_cols</code>,
but they are a bit more particular about what they will take:
<code>tibble</code> takes vectors (single variables) and
<code>bind_cols</code> takes vectors or data frames. The problem here is
that <code>pp</code> is not either of those:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1428"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1428-1" title="1"><span class="kw">class</span>(pp)</a></code></pre></div>

<li>Which of your two intervals is longer? Does this make

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The intervals are about 22.25 and 25.5 units long. The one for a
5-mile run is a bit longer. I think this makes sense because 3
miles is close to the average run distance, so there is a lot of
“nearby” data. 5 miles is actually longer than any of the runs
that were actually done (and therefore we are actually
extrapolating), but the important point for the prediction
interval is that there is less nearby data: those 2-mile runs
don’t help so much in predicting blood sugar after a 5-mile
run. (They help <em>some</em>, because the trend is so linear. This
is why the 5-mile interval is not <em>so</em> much longer. If the
trend were less clear, the 5-mile interval would be more
noticeably worse.)</p>

<p>On my residual plot, I see a slight curve in the smooth trend,

all over the place in a seemingly random pattern (the grey envelope is
wide and that is pretty close to going straight across). So I think a
straight line model is satisfactory.</p>

<p>A bit skewed to the left (the low ones are too low).</p>

<p>A tiny bit of fan-in (residuals getting <em>smaller</em> in size as the

<p>For the pizza with 12 grams of fat, the predicted calories are between
261 and 370 with 95% confidence, and for the pizza with 20 grams of
fat, the calories are predicted to be between 337 and 454. (You should
write down what these intervals are, and not leave the reader to find
them in the output.)</p>
<p>(Remember the steps: create a new data frame containing the values to
predict for, and then feed that into <code>predict</code> along with the
model that you want to use to predict with. The variable in the data
frame has to be called <em>precisely</em> <code>Fat</code> with a capital F,
otherwise it won’t work.)</p>
<p>These intervals are both pretty awful: you get a very weak picture of
how many calories per serving the pizza brands in question might
contain. This is for two reasons: (i) there was a fair bit of scatter
in the original relationship, R-squared being around 65%, and (ii)
even if we knew perfectly where the line went (which we don’t),
there’s no guarantee that individual brands of pizza would be on it
anyway. (Prediction intervals are always hit by this double whammy, in
that individual observations suffer from variability in where the line
goes <em>and</em> variability around whatever the line is.)</p>
<p>I was expecting, when I put together this question, that the
20-grams-of-fat interval would be noticeably worse, because 20 is
farther away from the mean fat content of all the brands. But there
isn’t much to choose. For the confidence intervals for the mean
calories of <em>all</em> brands with these fat contents, the picture is clearer:</p>

would guess.</p>
<p>This question is a fair bit of work for 3 points, so I’m not insisting that you explain
your choice of a prediction interval over a confidence interval, but I
think it is still a smart thing to do, even purely from a marks point
of view, because if you get it wrong for a semi-plausible reason, you
might pick up some partial credit. Not pulling out your prediction
intervals from your output is a sure way to lose a point, however.</p>

<p>In city planning, one major issue is where to locate fire
stations. If a city has too many fire stations, it will spend too much
on running them, but if it has too few, there may be unnecessary fire
damage because the fire trucks take too long to get to the fire.</p>
<p>The first part of a study of this kind of issue is to understand the
relationship between the distance from the fire station (measured in
miles in our data set) and the amount of fire damage caused (measured
in thousands of dollars). A city recorded the fire damage and distance
from fire station for 15 residential fires (which you can take as a
sample of “all possible residential fires in that city”). The data

<p>Solution</p>
<p>When the distance is larger, the fire damage is definitely larger,
so there is clearly a relationship. I would call this one
approximately linear: it wiggles a bit, but it is not to my mind
obviously curved. I would also call it a strong relationship,
since the points are close to the smooth trend.</p>

<p>We need to display the results, since we need to see the R-squared in
order to say something about it.</p>
<p>R-squared is about 92%, high, indicating a strong and linear
relationship. Back in part~(<a href="#part:howgood">here</a>), I said that the
relationship is linear and strong, which is entirely consistent with
such an R-squared. (If you said something different previously, say
how it does or doesn’t square with this kind of R-squared value.)</p>
<p>Points: one for fitting the regression, one for displaying it, and two
(at the grader’s discretion) for saying what the R-squared is and how
it’s consistent (or not) with part~(<a href="#part:howgood">here</a>).</p>
<p>Extra: if you thought the trend was “definitely curved”, you would
find that a parabola (or some other kind of curve) was definitely
better than a straight line. Here’s the parabola:</p>

<p>The cubic, in red, does bend a little, but it doesn’t do an obvious
job of going through the points better than the straight line does. It
seems to be mostly swayed by that one observation with damage over 40,
and choosing a relationship by how well it fits one point is flimsy at
the best of times. So, by Occam’s Razor, we go with the line rather
than the cubic because it (i) fits equally well, (ii) is simpler.</p>

<p>I printed them out like this since these give the centres of the
intervals as well as the lower and upper limits.</p>
<p>The centre of the interval is higher for the mean damage when the
distance is 4. This is because the mean distance is a bit less than 4:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1479"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1479-1" title="1">fire <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">summarize</span>(<span class="dt">m =</span> <span class="kw">mean</span>(distance))</a></code></pre></div>

  </script>
</div>
<p>We know it’s an upward trend, so our best guess at the mean damage is
higher if the mean distance is higher (in (<a href="#part:cim">here</a>), the
distance is <em>always</em> 4: we’re looking at the mean fire damage for
<em>all</em> residences that are 4 miles from a fire station.)</p>
<p>What about the lengths of the intervals? The one in (<a href="#part:ttest">here</a>)
is about <span class="math inline">\(30.9-21.9=9\)</span> (thousand dollars) long, but the one in
(<a href="#part:cim">here</a>) is only <span class="math inline">\(31.4-28.5=2.9\)</span> long, much shorter. This
makes sense because the relationship is a strong one: knowing the
distance from the fire station is very useful, because the bigger it
is, the bigger the damage going to be, with near certainty. Said
differently, if you know the distance, you can estimate the damage
accurately. If you don’t know the distance (as is the case in
(<a href="#part:ttest">here</a>)), you’re averaging over a lot of different
distances and thus there is a lot of uncertainty in the amount of fire
damage also.</p>
<p>If you have some reasonable discussion of the reason why the centres
and lengths of the intervals differ, I’m happy. It doesn’t have to be
the same as mine.</p>
