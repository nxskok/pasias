<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Atomic weight of carbon</h2>
<p>The atomic weight of the chemical element
carbon is 12. Two methods of measuring the atomic weight of samples of
carbon were compared. The results are shown in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/carbon.txt">link</a>. The methods
are labelled 1 and 2. The first task is to find out whether the two
methods have different “typical” measures (mean or median, as
appropriate) of the atomic weight of carbon.</p>
<p>For this question, compose a report in R Markdown. (R Markdown is
what you use in an R Notebook, but you can also have a separate R
Markdown document from which you can produce HTML, Word etc. output.)
See part (a) for how to get this started.</p>
<p>Your report should
read like an actual report, not just the answers to some questions
that I set you. To help with that, write some text that links the
parts of the report together smoothly, so that it reads as a coherent
whole. The grader had 3 discretionary marks to award for the overall
quality of your writing. The scale for this was:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3 points: excellent writing. The report flows smoothly, is easy
to read, and contains everything it should (and nothing it
shouldn’t).</p></li>
<li><p>2 points: satisfactory writing. Not the easiest to read, but
says what it should, and it looks at least somewhat like a report
rather than a string of answers to questions.</p></li>
<li><p>1 point: writing that is hard to read or to understand. If you
get this (or 0), you should consider what you need to do to improve
when you write your project.</p></li>
<li><p>0 points: you answered the questions, but you did almost nothing
to make it read like a report.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Create a new R Markdown document. To do this, in R Studio, select File,
New File, R Markdown. Type the report title and your name in the
boxes, and leave the output on the default HTML. Click OK.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an introduction that explains the purpose of this
study and the data collected in your own words.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin an appropriately-titled new section in your report,
read the data into R and display the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Make an appropriate plot to compare the measurements
obtained by the two methods. You might need to do something about
the two methods being given as numbers even though they are really
only identifiers. (If you do, your report ought to say what you did

<p>A programming course, Comp Sci 101, can be taken either in-person, by attending a class at fixed days and times, or online, by doing sessions that can be taken at times the student chooses. The course coordinator wants to know whether students taking the course in these two different ways learn a different amount, as measured by their scores on the final exam for the course. This example comes from the before-times, so the final exam was taken in person by all students. The final exam was out of 45 marks. A total of 18 students took part in the study.

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dandruff/symptoms-causes/syc-20353850">Mayo Clinic</a>, dandruff is “a common condition that causes the skin on the scalp to flake. It isn’t contagious or serious. But it can be embarrassing and difficult to treat.” Shampoos often claim to be effective in treating dandruff. In a study, four shampoos were compared:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PyrI</code>: 1% pyrithione zinc shampoo</li>
<li><code>PyrII</code>: the same as <code>PyrI</code> but with instructions to shampoo two times at each wash. The labels for these are <code>Pyr</code> with a Roman numeral I or II attached.</li>
<li><code>Keto</code>: 2% ketoconazole shampoo</li>
<li><code>Placebo</code>: a placebo shampoo</li>
</ul>
<p>Each subject was randomly assigned to a shampoo. After six weeks of treatment, eight sections of the scalp were examined for each subject. Each section of the scalp was given a score that measured the amount of flaking on a scale of 0-10, less flaking being better. The response variable, called <code>Flaking</code>, was the sum of these eight scores, and is a whole number for each subject.</p>
<p>The data are in <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/dandruff.txt">http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/dandruff.txt</a>,

<p>Your task is to write a report on your analysis of this data set, and to make a recommendation for the best shampoo(s) out of the four studied here. The target audience for your report is the principal investigator of the study described above, who knows a lot about shampoo, but not so much about statistics.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.5</span> Atomic weight of carbon</h2>
<p>The atomic weight of the chemical element
carbon is 12. Two methods of measuring the atomic weight of samples of
carbon were compared. The results are shown in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/carbon.txt">link</a>. The methods

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The appropriate plot, with a categorical method and quantitative
weight, is something like a boxplot. If you’re not careful,
<code>method</code> will get treated as a quantitative variable,
which you don’t want; the easiest way around that, for a boxplot
at least, is to turn it into a factor like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb25-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb25-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(carbon, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> <span class="kw">factor</span>(method), <span class="dt">y =</span> weight)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If you insist, you could do a faceted histogram (above and below, for preference):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb26-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(carbon, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> weight)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins =</span> <span class="dv">5</span>) <span class="op">+</span></span>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There are really not enough data values for a histogram to be of much
help, so I don’t like this as much.</p>
<p>If you are thinking ahead (we are going to be doing a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test), then
you’ll realize that normality is the kind of thing we’re looking for,
in which case normal quantile plots would be the thing. However, we
might have to be rather forgiving for method 2 since there are only 5
observations:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb27-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(carbon, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> weight)) <span class="op">+</span></span>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I don’t mind these coming out side by side, though I would rather have
them squarer.</p>
<p>I would say, boxplots are the best, normal quantile plots are also
acceptable, but expect to lose something for histograms because they
offer only a rather crude comparison in this case.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Comment briefly on what you see in your plot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>In boxplots, if that’s what you drew, there are several things
that deserve comment: the medians, the spreads and the
shapes. The median for method 1 is a little bit lower than for
method 2 (the means are probably more different, given the
shapes of the boxes). The spread for method 2 is a lot
bigger. (Looking forward, that suggests a Welch-Satterthwaite
rather than a pooled test.) As for shape, the method 2
measurements seem more or less symmetric (the whiskers are equal
anyway, even if the position of the median in the box isn’t),
but the method 1 measurements have a low outlier.
The histograms are hard to compare. Try to say something about
centre and spread and shape. I think the method 2 histogram has
a slightly higher centre and definitely bigger spread. On my
histogram for method 1, the distribution looks skewed left.
If you did normal quantile plots, say something sensible about
normality for each of the two methods. For method 1, I would say
the low value is an outlier and the rest of the values look
pretty straight. Up to you whether you think there is a curve on
the plot (which would indicate skewness, but then that highest
value is too high: it would be bunched up with the other values
below 12.01 if there were really skewness).
For method 2, it’s really hard to say anything since there are
only five values. Given where the line goes, there isn’t much
you can say to doubt normality. Perhaps the best you can say
here is that in a sample of size 5, it’s difficult to assess
normality at all.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>This would be the Welch-Satterthwaite version of the two-sample
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, since the two groups do appear to have different spreads:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb28-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb28-1"></a><span class="kw">t.test</span>(weight <span class="op">~</span><span class="st"> </span>method, <span class="dt">data =</span> carbon)</span></code></pre></div>

## sample estimates:

##        12.00260        12.01428</code></pre>
<p>Imagining that this is a report that would go to your boss, you ought
to defend your choice of the Welch-Satterthwaite test (as I did
above), and not just do the default <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test without comment.</p>
<p>If, in your discussion above, you thought the spreads were equal
enough, then you should do the pooled <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test here, which goes like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb30-1"></a><span class="kw">t.test</span>(weight <span class="op">~</span><span class="st"> </span>method, <span class="dt">data =</span> carbon, <span class="dt">var.equal =</span> T)</span></code></pre></div>

## sample estimates:
## mean in group 1 mean in group 2 
##        12.00260        12.01428</code></pre>
<p>The point here is that you should do the right test based on your
conclusion. Being consistent is the most important thing. (In this
case, note that the P-values are very different. We’ll get to that
shortly.)</p>
<p>If we were doing this in SAS, as we see later, we’d get a test at the
bottom of the output that compares the two variances. I feel that it’s
just as good to eyeball the spreads and make a call about whether they
are “reasonably close”. Or even, to always do the
Welch-Satterthwaite test on the basis that it is pretty good even if
the two populations have the same variance. (If this last point of
view is one that you share, you ought to say something about that when
you do your <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test.)</p>
<p>Extra: I guess this is a good place to say something about tests for comparing
variances, given that you might be pondering that. There are
several that I can think of, that R can do, of which I mention two.</p>
<p>The first is the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test for variances that you might have learned in
B57 (that is the basis for the ANOVA <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb32"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb32-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb32-1"></a><span class="kw">var.test</span>(weight <span class="op">~</span><span class="st"> </span>method, <span class="dt">data =</span> carbon)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
##  F test to compare two variances
## 
## data:  weight by method
## F = 0.35768, num df = 9, denom df = 4, p-value = 0.1845
## alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.04016811 1.68758230
## sample estimates:
## ratio of variances 
##          0.3576842</code></pre>
<p>This, unfortunately, is rather dependent on the data in the two groups
being approximately normal. Since we are talking variances rather than
means, there is no Central Limit Theorem to rescue us for large
samples (quite aside from the fact that these samples are <em>not</em>
large). Since the ANOVA <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test is based on the same theory, this is
why normality is also more important in ANOVA than it is in a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test.</p>
<p>The second is Levene’s test. This doesn’t depend on normality (at
least, not nearly so much), so I like it better in general:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb34"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb34-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb34-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(car)</span>

<pre><code>## Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)
##       Df F value Pr(&gt;F)
## group  1  0.9887 0.3382
##       13</code></pre>
<p>Levene’s test takes a different approach: first the absolute
differences from the group medians are calculated, and then an ANOVA
is run on the absolute differences. If, say, one of the groups has a
larger spread than the other(s), its absolute differences from the
median will tend to be bigger.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
As for what we conclude here, well, neither of the variance tests show
any significance at all, so from that point of view there is no
evidence against using the pooled <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. Having said that, the
samples are small, and so it would be difficult to <em>prove</em> that
the two methods have different variance, even if they actually
did.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Things are never as clear-cut as you would like. In the end, it all
comes down to making a call and defending it.</p>

<p>As an aside, if you have run into a non-parametric test such as
Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis that applies in this situation, be
careful about using it here, because they have additional assumptions
that you may not want to trust. Mann-Whitney started life as a test for
“equal distributions.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> This
means that the null is equal location <em>and</em> equal spread, and if
you reject the null, one of those has failed. But here, we suspect that
equal spread will fail, so that the Mann-Whitney test may end up
rejecting <em>whether or not</em> the medians are different, so it won’t
answer the question you want an answer to. Mood’s median test doesn’t
have that problem; all it’s saying if the null is true is that the
medians are equal; the spreads could be anything at all.</p>
<p>The same kind of issues apply to the signed-rank test vs. the sign
test. In the case of the signed-rank test, the extra assumption is of
a symmetric distribution — to my mind, if you don’t believe
normality, you probably don’t have much confidence in symmetry
either. That’s why I like the sign test and Mood’s median test: in the
situation where you don’t want to be dealing with assumptions, these
tests don’t make you worry about that.</p>
<p>Another comment that you don’t need to make is based on the
not-quite-significance of the Mood test. The P-value is less than 0.10
but not less than 0.05, so it doesn’t quite reach significance by the
usual standard. But if you look up at the table, the frequencies seem
rather unbalanced: 6 out of the remaining 9 weights in group 1 are
below the overall median, but 4 out of 5 weights in group 2 are
above. This seems as if it ought to be significant, but bear in mind
that the sample sizes are small, and thus Mood’s median test needs

<li>Discuss the results of your tests and what they say about
the two methods for measuring the atomic weight of carbon. If it
seems appropriate, put the discussion into a section called
Conclusions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Begin by pulling out the P-values for your preferred test(s) and
say what they mean. The P-value for the Welch-Satterthwaite
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is 0.1238, which indicates no difference in mean atomic
weights between the two methods. The Mood median test gives a
similarly non-significant 0.0943, indicating no difference in
the <em>median</em> weights. If you think both tests are
plausible, then give both P-values and do a compare-and-contrast
with them; if you think that one of the tests is clearly
preferable, then say so (and why) and focus on that test’s
results.</p>
<p>If you thought the pooled test was the right one, then you’ll
have a bit more discussion to do, since its P-value is 0.0499,
and at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> this test disagrees with the others. If you
are comparing this test with the Mood test, you ought to make
some kind of reasoned recommendation about which test to
believe.</p>
<p>As ever, be consistent in your reasoning.</p>
<p>This dataset, where I found it, was actually being used to
illustrate a case where the pooled and the Welch-Satterthwaite
tests disagreed. The authors of the original paper that used
this dataset (a 1987 paper by Rayner and Best,
; the data come from 1924!) point out that the
pooled <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test can be especially misleading when the smaller
sample is also the one with the larger variance. This is what
happened here.</p>
<p>In the Rayner and Best paper, the Mood (or the Mann-Whitney) test was
not being considered, but I think it’s good practice to draw a
picture and make a call about which test is appropriate.</p>

<p>For you, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="sh2.png" /></p>
<p>We don’t know how many rows of data there are yet, so I’ve left a
“placeholder” for it, when we figure it out.
The file is annoyingly called <code>sparrowhawk.txt</code>,
singular. Sorry about that.
If you knit this (click on “Knit HTML” next to the ball of wool,
or press control-shift-K), it should run, and you’ll see a viewer
pop up with the HTML output. Now you can see how many rows there
are, and you can go back and edit the R Markdown and put in 13 in
place of the x’s, and knit again.
You might be worried about how hard R is working with all this
knitting. Don’t worry about that. R can take it.
Mine looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="waluj.png" /></p>
<p>There is a better way of adding values that come from the output,
which I mention here in case you are interested (if you are not,
feel free to skip this). What you do is to make what is called an
“inline code chunk”. Where you want a number to appear in the
text, you have some R Markdown that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="sh3.png" /></p>
<p>The piece inside the backticks is the letter <code>r</code>, a space,
and then one line of R code. The one line of code will be run, and
all of the stuff within the backticks will be replaced in the
output by the result of running the R code, in this case the
number 13. Typically, you are extracting a number from the data,
like the number of rows or a mean of something. If it’s a decimal
number, it will come out with a lot of decimal places unless you
explicitly <code>round</code> it.
OK, let me try it: the data frame has 13
rows altogether. I didn’t type that number; it was calculated from
the data frame. Woo hoo!</p>

<p>A programming course, Comp Sci 101, can be taken either in-person, by attending a class at fixed days and times, or online, by doing sessions that can be taken at times the student chooses. The course coordinator wants to know whether students taking the course in these two different ways learn a different amount, as measured by their scores on the final exam for the course. This example comes from the before-times, so the final exam was taken in person by all students. The final exam was out of 45 marks. A total of 18 students took part in the study. Each student was allowed to choose the section they preferred. The data are in .</p>
<p>Write a report of a complete and appropriate analysis of these data. Your report should include a description of the data in your own words, any necessary pre-processing steps, appropriate graphs, statistical analysis, assessment of assumptions for your preferred analysis, and a statement of conclusions. Imagine that your report will be read by the department Chair, who does not know about this study, and who still remembers some of their first-year Statistics course.</p>

</div>
<div id="analysis" class="section level2" number="14.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.10</span> Analysis</h2>
<p>We begin by visualizing the data. With one quantitative variable <code>mark</code> and one categorical variable <code>instruction</code>, a boxplot will give us an overall picture (see note 3):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb56-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb56-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(prog, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span> instruction, <span class="dt">y =</span> mark)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It looks as if the average (median) mark is somewhat higher for the students in the online section. In addition, both distributions look reasonably symmetric with no outliers, and they appear to have similar spread. (see note 4.)</p>
<p>With that in mind, it seems sensible to compare the mean final exam marks in the two groups by a pooled two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, in order to see whether the apparent difference in performance is any more than chance. The aim of the course coordinator was to see whether there was any difference between the two sections, without having any prior idea about which teaching method would be better, so a two-sided test is appropriate: (see note 5.)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb57-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb57-1"></a><span class="kw">t.test</span>(mark<span class="op">~</span>instruction, <span class="dt">data =</span> prog, <span class="dt">var.equal =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
##  Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  mark by instruction
## t = -1.6495, df = 16, p-value = 0.1185
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -8.379039  1.045706
## sample estimates:
## mean in group classroom    mean in group online 
##                31.55556                35.22222</code></pre>
<p>The P-value of 0.1185 is not smaller than 0.05, so there is no evidence of any difference between the mean final exam marks of the students in the two sections. The difference between the two groups shown on the boxplot is the kind of thing that could be observed by chance if the students were performing equally well under the two methods of instruction. (See notes 6 and 7.)</p>
<p>This <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test comes with the assumption that the data in each group come from a normal distribution, at least approximately. With two small samples, this will not be easy to assess, but we can at least look for any gross violations, using a normal quantile plot for each group:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb59"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb59-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb59-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(prog, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> mark)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>() <span class="op">+</span></span>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-53-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The largest observation in the classroom group and the largest two observations in the online group are a little bigger than expected, but they were not big enough to be flagged as outliers on the boxplots, so I conclude that the normality is good enough to justify the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test that we did. (See note 8.)</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions-see-note-9" class="section level2" number="14.11">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.11</span> Conclusions (see note 9)</h2>
<p>We found that there is no significant difference in the performance of the students learning in the classroom compared to those learning online. Before leaping to generalize to other classes, however, we should note two limitations of the study (see note 10):</p>
<ul>
<li>the sample sizes were very small; if we had observed this size of difference between the two groups in larger samples, we might have been able to show that the difference was significant.</li>
<li>we have no information about how the students were allocated to the groups, and it seems likely that the students were allowed to choose their own method of instruction. If the students had been randomly allocated to instruction method, we could have been more confident that any differences observed were due to the instruction method, rather than also having something to do with the relative ability of the students who chose each instruction method.</li>
</ul>
<p>We feel that it would be worth running another study of this type, but with larger sample sizes and randomly allocating students to instruction types. This latter, however, risks running into ethical difficulties, since students will normally wish to choose the section they are in.</p>
<p>Thus ends the report.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>

<li><p>Say something about the kind of data layout you have, and whether it’s what you want.</p></li>
<li><p>You can do a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test without rearranging the data (the method is that of the “all possible <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests” discussion in the ANOVA section), but if you try to draw plots with the data laid out that way, you will at best be repeating yourself a lot and at worst get stuck (if you try to make side-by-side boxplots).

</ol>
<p>I split the pivot-longer onto several lines so that it wouldn’t run off the right side of the page.

<li><p>A normal quantile plot is also justifiable here, but I think it would take more justification, because you would have to sell your reader on the need for normality this early in the story.

If you do a normal quantile plot here, you can formally assess the assumptions before you do the test, which you might argue makes more sense, rather than doing a second plot and assessing the assumptions later as I do.</p></li>
<li><p>You might be able to justify a one-sided test here, along the lines of “is the online instruction significantly <em>worse</em>?”, but in any case, you need to justify the one-sided or two-sided test that you do.</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusion <em>in the context of the data</em>, as ever. Writing “we fail to reject the null hypothesis” and then stopping invites your reader to ask “so what?”.</p></li>
<li><p>You might have chosen to do a different test, but your choice needs to be properly justified. I think the pooled <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is the best choice here. If you thought those marks were not normal enough, then you need to do Mood’s median test, explaining why. That comes out like this:</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb60"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb60-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb60-1"></a><span class="kw">median_test</span>(prog, mark, instruction)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## $table
##            above

## 1 statistic 2.0000000
## 2        df 1.0000000
## 3   P-value 0.1572992</code></pre>
<p>The (two-sided) P-value is a little bigger than the one for the pooled <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, but the conclusion is the same. (If you think the test should be one-sided, justify dividing your P-value by 2, if you can. In the case that your one-sided alternative was that classroom teaching was <em>better</em>, you cannot reject the null in favour of that, because the online students actually have better marks in these samples. In that case, halving the P-value would not be justifiable.)</p>
<p>If you thought that the normality was all right, but the equal spreads was not, you will need to justify the unequal spreads. Perhaps the best way here is to say that you are unsure whether the spreads are close enough to equal, so you are doing the Welch test to be safe. That looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb62"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb62-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb62-1"></a><span class="kw">t.test</span>(mark<span class="op">~</span>instruction, <span class="dt">data =</span> prog)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>As you see, the P-values of the pooled and Welch <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests are almost identical (which is what I was guessing), but to do the Welch test without comment reveals that you are <em>not thinking</em> about which of the two tests is more appropriate here. In the real world, you might get away with it (for these data, the conclusions are the same), but in this course I need to see that your thought process is correct.</p>
<p>A final observation in this note: all three tests give you similar P-values and the same conclusion, so that in the end it didn’t really matter which one of them you did. When that happens, it’s usually (as here) a sign that a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test will be best, because it makes the best use of the data (and thus you will get the most power in your test). I cannot stop you doing all three tests behind the scenes and using this to help decide, but strictly speaking your P-value will not be what you say it is, because these tests (really, any tests) are designed so that the test you choose is the only one you do. In any case, your <em>report</em> should include only the <em>one</em> test you thought was most appropriate. Your reader does not have the time or patience for a detailed comparison of the three tests.</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You might have combined the assessment of assumptions with your first plot, particularly if you chose a normal quantile plot instead of a boxplot there. As long as you have assessed normality (and equal spreads, if you are happy with the normality) somewhere, this is fine. In particular, if you ended up doing a Mood median test, you have presumably already decided that the normality was not good enough, and (I hope) you already discussed that somewhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, bear in mind who is (in the setup that we have) reading your report: someone who might remember about <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests and normality. Ideas like the bootstrap are <em>far</em> too advanced to go into a report like this. If you must include something like that, you need to put it in an appendix, not the main body of the report, so that the person reading your report can get the main ideas without having to wade through that.</p>
<p>The rest of this note is an Extra:</p>
<p>Here is a slightly different way to approach the bootstrap in this case, that takes care of assessing the normality of both groups at once.</p>
<p>The first step is <code>nest_by</code>, which does two things, one of which is invisible:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb64-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb64-1"></a>prog <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">nest_by</span>(instruction)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This (visibly) creates a list-column containing two mini dataframes <code>data</code>. They are the original data with all the data except <code>instruction</code> in each one: that is, the other column <code>mark</code>. The top one is the nine marks for the students in the <code>classroom</code> section, and the bottom one is the nine marks for the students in the <code>online</code> section. The invisible thing is that <code>nest_by</code> includes a <code>rowwise</code>, so that what we do after this is one for <em>each</em> row, one at a time.</p>
<p>What we do next is to generate a lot of bootstrap samples, for each group. First, a vector of simulation numbers, one for each method of instruction. This only needs to be said once because <code>nest_by</code> is like <code>group_by</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb65"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb65-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb65-1"></a>prog <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">nest_by</span>(instruction) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb65-2"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb65-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(<span class="dt">sim =</span> <span class="kw">list</span>(<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">10</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we need to <code>unnest</code> those <code>sim</code>s, so that we can put a bootstrap sample next to each one:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb66"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb66-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb66-1"></a>prog <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">nest_by</span>(instruction) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb66-2"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb66-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(<span class="dt">sim =</span> <span class="kw">list</span>(<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">10</span>)) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb66-3"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb66-3"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">unnest</span>(sim)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we draw a bootstrap sample from the <code>data</code> to the left of each <code>sim</code> (the ones next to <code>classroom</code> are the in-person ones, and the ones next to <code>online</code> are the online ones, so we will be taking bootstrap samples of the right thing). This here is where the <code>rowwise</code> goes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb67"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb67-1"><a href="writing-reports.html#cb67-1"></a>prog <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">nest_by</span>(instruction) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>

<p>These are close to their lines, which tells me indeed that the two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test I did was perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>As I say, though, this is very much for <em>you</em>, and not for the report, given who would be reading it. If you were doing a presentation on this, the bootstrap stuff is something you would keep in reserve in case someone asks about the appropriateness of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, and <em>then</em> you could talk about it, but otherwise you wouldn’t mention it at all.</p>
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You definitely need some conclusions. If the department chair is busy (quite likely), this is the only part of the entire report they may be able to read.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the place to put limitations, and recommendations for next time. The sample size one is (I hope) obvious, but you can also get at the other one by asking yourself how the students were assigned to instruction methods. The classical comparative study assigns them at random; that way, you know that the two groups of students are at least supposed to be about equal on ability (and anything else) before you start. But if the students choose their own groups, it might be that (say) the weaker students choose the classroom instruction, and in that case the reason the online group came out looking better might be that they were stronger students: it could have nothing to do with the effectiveness of the learning environment at all.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.12</span> Treating dandruff</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dandruff/symptoms-causes/syc-20353850">Mayo Clinic</a>, dandruff is “a common condition that causes the skin on the scalp to flake. It isn’t contagious or serious. But it can be embarrassing and difficult to treat.” Shampoos often claim to be effective in treating dandruff. In a study, four shampoos were compared:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PyrI</code>: 1% pyrithione zinc shampoo</li>
<li><code>PyrII</code>: the same as <code>PyrI</code> but with instructions to shampoo two times at each wash. The labels for these are <code>Pyr</code> with a Roman numeral I or II attached.</li>
<li><code>Keto</code>: 2% ketoconazole shampoo</li>
<li><code>Placebo</code>: a placebo shampoo</li>
</ul>
<p>Each subject was randomly assigned to a shampoo. After six weeks of treatment, eight sections of the scalp were examined for each subject. Each section of the scalp was given a score that measured the amount of flaking on a scale of 0-10, less flaking being better. The response variable, called <code>Flaking</code>, was the sum of these eight scores, and is a whole number for each subject.</p>
<p>The data are in <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/dandruff.txt">http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/dandruff.txt</a>,
with the data values separated by <em>tabs</em>.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a report on your analysis of this data set, and to make a recommendation for the best shampoo(s) out of the four studied here. The target audience for your report is the principal investigator of the study described above, who knows a lot about shampoo, but not so much about statistics. (They took a course some time ago that covered the material you’ve seen in this course so far, at about the level of STAB22 or STA 220.)
Some things you might want to consider, in no particular order (you need to think about where and if to include these things):</p>
<ul>
<li>an Introduction, written in your own words as much as possible</li>
<li>a Conclusion that summarizes what you found</li>
<li>a suitable and complete piece of statistical inference</li>
<li>a numerical summary of the data</li>
<li>graph(s) of the data</li>
<li>an assessment of the assumptions of your analysis</li>
<li>citation of external sources</li>
<li>anything else that you can make the case for including</li>
</ul>
<p>In R Markdown (the text of an R Notebook), you can use <code>##</code> to make a heading (you can experiment with more or fewer <code>#</code> symbols).</p>
<p>Your aim is to produce a report, suitable for the intended audience, with all the important elements and no irrelevant ones, that is well-written and easy to follow. There is credit for good writing. For this report, you should include your code in with your report. (In a real report, you would probably show the output and not the code, but we are interested in your code here as well.)</p>
