<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Throwing baseballs and softballs</h2>
<p>Can students throw a baseball farther than a softball? A
statistics class, containing 24 students, went out to a football field
to try to answer this question. Each student warmed up and then threw
each type of ball as far as they could. The order of ball types was
randomized: some students threw the baseball first, and some threw the
softball first. (A softball is bigger than a baseball, so we might
expect that a softball would be harder to throw a long way than a
baseball.) The data are in
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/throw.txt">http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/throw.txt</a> in three
columns: the first is a number identifying the student, the second is
the distance thrown with the baseball (in yards) and the third is the
distance thrown with the softball (also in yards).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.4</span> Changes in salary</h2>
<p>A company is growing and would like to attract more
employees. The company would like to advertise that salaries there are
increasing. To do this, the company randomly samples 20 employees that
have been working there since January 2016, and for each of these
employees, records their salary in January 2016 and January 2017. The
data, with salaries in thousands of dollars, are in

At the beginning of their session, each teacher took a listening test (to test their understanding of spoken French). After 4 weeks of immersion in French, each teacher took a similar listening test again. (The actual French spoken in the two tests was different, so simply taking the first test should not improve the score in the second one; the tests were otherwise similar.) The maximum score on each test was 36, and a higher score is better. The data are <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/frenchtest.txt">here</a>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.8</span> Measuring body fat</h2>
<p>Athletes are concerned with measuring their body fat
percentage. Two different methods are available: one using ultrasound,
and the other using X-ray technology. We are interested in whether
there is a difference in the mean body fat percentage as measured by
these two methods, and if so, how big that difference is. Data on 16
athletes are at
<a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/bodyfat.txt">link</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Explain briefly why a matched pairs analysis is more
suitable for these data than a two-independent-samples analysis
(using a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test). You might find that looking at the
data (clicking on the link) helps you figure this out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The data file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>
athlete xray ultrasound
1 5.00 4.75
2 7 3.75
3 9.25 9
4 12 11.75
5 17.25 17
6 29.5 27.5
7 5.5 6.5
8 6 6.75
9 8 8.75
10 8.5 9.5
11 9.25 9.5
12 11 12
13 12 12.25
14 14 15.5
15 17 18
16 18 18.25
</code></pre>
<p>The data are two measurements for each of the 16 athletes: that
is, each athlete had their body fat percentage measured using
<em>both</em> of the two methods.
Extra: a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> approach would be reasonable if one set of 16
athletes had been measured by X-ray and <em>another different</em>
set of 16 athletes had been measured by ultrasound. (That is, if
there had been 32 athletes in total, with each one randomly
assigned to <em>one</em> of the measurement methods.) But that’s not
what happened. It is easy to measure one athlete’s body fat
percentage using both of the two methods, so a matched pairs
design is easy to implement (as well as being better). If you use
two independent samples (each athlete doing only one measurement
method), you introduce an extra source of variability: athletes
differ one from another in body fat, as well as differing possibly
by measurement method. If you use a matched-pairs design, you
remove the athlete-to-athlete differences, leaving only the
differences due to measurement method.</p>

way to do this is to
use a pipeline: use a <code>mutate</code> to create the column of
differences, and then pipe that into <code>ggplot</code>, omitting the
data frame that would normally go first (the input data frame here
is the new one with the differences in it, which doesn’t have a
name). I’ll make a normal quantile plot in a moment, but if you
haven’t seen that yet, the plot to make is a histogram:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>I don’t know whether you’d call that “approximately normal” or
not. We are in kind of a double-bind with this one: the sample size is
small, so normality matters, but with a small sample, the data might
not look very normal. It’s kind of skewed right, but most of the
evidence for the skewness is contained in those two observations with
difference 2 and above, which is pretty flimsy evidence for
anything. (In the normal quantile plot below, the suggestion is that
those two observations really are a bit too large. It’s easier to tell
there.)</p>
<p>Below, I’m repeating the calculation of the differences, which is
inefficient. If I’m going to draw two graphs of the differences, the
right way is to calculate the differences , then use that new data frame twice. But you’re probably only
going to draw either the histogram or the normal quantile plot, not
both, so you can use the appropriate one of my two bits of code. The
normal quantile plot:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This is showing a little evidence of skewness or outliers (depending
on your point of view: either is good). The lowest and highest values
are both too high, and the pattern of points on the plot is kind of
curved (which would be evidence of skewness). Or you could say that
the two highest values are too high, with the other values being more
or less in line (that would be evidence of outliers at the upper
end). I like outliers better than skewness, since those bottom-end
points are not far off the line. I would also accept
“no substantial problems”,
if you can make the case that those two highest points are
not too far off the line. With only 16 observations as we have here,
even truly normal data would stray off the line a bit.</p>
<p>As ever, your explanation is more important than your conclusion. Can
you justify what you think?</p>
<p>If you took your differences the other way around, as
<code>ultrasound</code> minus <code>xray</code>, your plot will also be the
other way around, with the “outliers” at the bottom. That’s good
too.</p>
<p>Where this is going (which I didn’t ask you) is whether or not we
trust the result of the matched pairs test. I would say that the test
is so far from being significant, and the failure of normality is not
gross, that it is hard to imagine <em>any</em> alternative test coming
up with a significant result. So I would be happy to trust this paired

<p>or count those less than zero. I’d take any of those.</p>
<p>Note that these are <em>not all the same</em>. One of the differences is
in fact exactly zero. The technically right thing to do with the zero
difference is to throw it away (leaving 23 differences with 2 negative
and 21 positive). I would take that, or 2 or 3 negative differences
out of 24 (depending on whether you count “greater than zero” or
“less than zero”). We hope that this won’t make a material
difference to the P-value; it’ll make some difference, but won’t (we
hope) change the conclusion about whether to reject.</p>
<p>Second step is to get a P-value for whichever one of those you got,
from the appropriate binomial distribution.</p>
<p>The P-value is the probability of getting 21 (or 22) positive
differences out of 24 (or 23) or more, since this is the end of the
distribution we should be at if the alternative hypothesis is correct.

<p>As we hoped, there is no <em>material</em> difference here: there is no

<p>The rest of the way, we are trying to reproduce that confidence

The function is called <code>pval_sign</code>. If you haven’t run into it

click on its name. This will bring up package help, which
includes a list of all the functions in the package, along with
a brief description of what each one does. (Clicking
on a function name brings up the help for that function.)
Let’s check that it works properly by repeating the previous

the same thing:</p>

<li>Based on your P-value, do you think 0 is inside the confidence

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Absolutely not. The median difference is definitely not
zero, so zero cannot be in the confidence interval.
Our suspicion, from the one-sided test from earlier, is that
the differences were mostly positive (people could throw a
baseball farther than a softball, in most cases). So the
confidence interval ought to contain only positive values.
I ask this because it drives what happens below.</p>

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I’ve given you a fair bit of freedom to tackle this as you
wish. Anything that makes sense is good: whatever mixture of
mindlessness, guesswork and cleverness that you want to employ.
The most mindless way to try some values one at a time and see what
you get, eg.:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb71"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb71-1"><a href="matched-pairs-t-and-sign-test.html#cb71-1"></a><span class="kw">pval_sign</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, throws, diff)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.001489639</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb73"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb73-1"><a href="matched-pairs-t-and-sign-test.html#cb73-1"></a><span class="kw">pval_sign</span>(<span class="dv">5</span>, throws, diff)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.168188</code></pre>
<p>So median 1 is outside and median 5 is inside the 95% interval. Keep
trying values until you’ve figured out where the lower and upper ends
of the interval are: where the P-values cross from below 0.05 to
above, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Something more intelligent is to make a long list of potential
medians, and get the P-value for each of them, eg.:</p>

<p>The top end is 9, 9 being inside and 9.5 outside.</p>
<p>Since the data values are all whole numbers, I think this is accurate enough.
The most sophisticated way is the “bisection” idea we saw before. We
already have a kickoff for this, since we found, mindlessly, that 1 is
outside the interval on the low end and 5 is inside, so the lower
limit has to be between 1 and 5. Let’s try halfway between, ie. 3:</p>

<p>The difficult bit is to decide whether the value <code>try</code> becomes
the new <code>lo</code> or the new <code>hi</code>. If the P-value for the
median of <code>try</code> is greater than 0.05, <code>try</code> is inside
the interval, and it becomes the new <code>hi</code>; otherwise it’s
outside and becomes the new <code>lo</code>. Whatever the values are,
<code>lo</code> is always outside the interval and <code>hi</code> is always
inside, and they move closer and closer to each other.</p>
<p>At the other end of the interval, <code>lo</code> is inside and
<code>hi</code> is outside, so there is a little switching around within
the loop. For starting values, you can be fairly mindless: for
example, we know that 5 is inside and something big like 20 must be outside:</p>

<p>The interval goes from 2 to (as calculated here) about 9. (This is
apparently the same as <code>ci_median</code> in <code>smmr</code> got.)
<code>ci_median</code> uses the bisection method with a smaller “tolerance” than we
did, so its answer is more accurate. It looks as if the interval goes
from 2 to 9: that is, students can throw a baseball on average between
2 and 9 feet further than they can throw a softball.</p>

<p>There are 20 employees (rows), and two columns of salaries: for each
employee in the data set, their salary in January 2016 and in January
2017 (thus, two salaries for each employee).</p>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>To compare the salaries, explain briefly why a
matched-pairs test would be better than a two-sample test.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>A matched-pairs test would be better because we have two
observations (salaries) for each subject (employee). A two-sample
test would be appropriate if we had two separate sets of
employees, one set with their salaries recorded in 2016 and the
other with their salaries recorded in 2017. That is not what we
have here.
You can go after this either way: why a matched-pairs approach is
appropriate, or why a two-sample approach is not (or a bit of both).</p>

<li>Make a suitable graph to assess the assumptions for a

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This requires thought first before you do any coding (and this is
the reason for this one being four points). What has to be at
least approximately normally distributed is the set of
<em>differences</em>, salary at one time point minus the salary at
the other, for each employee. The individual salaries don’t have
to be normally distributed at all.
We don’t have the differences here, so we have to calculate them
first. The smoothest way is to make a pipeline:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb87"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb87-1"><a href="matched-pairs-t-and-sign-test.html#cb87-1"></a>salaries <span class="op">%&gt;%</span></span>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-64-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>A couple of coding notes: (i) you can take the differences 2016 minus
2017 if you like (then they will tend to be negative), (ii)
<code>ggplot</code> used in a pipeline like this does <em>not</em> have a
data frame first (the data frame used is the nameless output from the
<code>mutate</code>, with the differences in it).</p>
<p>Also, there’s no problem doing the <code>mutate</code>, saving that, and
then feeding the saved data frame into <code>ggplot</code>. If you find
that clearer, go for it.</p>
<p>As for what I see: I think those points get a bit far from the
line at the high and low ends: the high values are too high and the
low values are too low, which is to say that we have outliers at both
ends, or the distribution has long tails (either way of saying it is
good).</p>
<p>The important conclusion here is whether these differences are normal
<em>enough</em> to trust a matched pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test here. We have a sample
of size 20, so the central limit theorem will help us some, but you
can reasonably say that these tails are too long and that we should
not trust a matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test.</p>
<p>I actually wanted you to practice doing a matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test
anyway, hence my comment in the next part, but the result is probably
not <em>so</em> trustworthy.</p>

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The company is trying to prove that salaries are <em>increasing</em>
over time, so we need a one-sided alternative.
Following through the procedure, even though you may not trust it much:</p>

<p>You could also have the years the other way around, in which case the
alternative has to be the other way around as well:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb90"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb90-1"><a href="matched-pairs-t-and-sign-test.html#cb90-1"></a><span class="kw">with</span>(salaries, <span class="kw">t.test</span>(jan2017, jan2016, <span class="dt">alternative =</span> <span class="st">&quot;greater&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">paired =</span> T))</span></code></pre></div>

<li>Calculate the differences, and make a normal quantile plot of

Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is a good place to look ahead. We’ll need the differences in two
places, most likely: first for the normal quantile plot, and second
for the matched-pairs sign test. So we should calculate and save them first:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb101"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb101-1"><a href="matched-pairs-t-and-sign-test.html#cb101-1"></a>bodyfat <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(<span class="dt">diff =</span> xray <span class="op">-</span><span class="st"> </span>ultrasound) -&gt;<span class="st"> </span>bodyfat2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I seem to be using a 2 on the end to name my
dataframe-with-differences, but you can use whatever name you like.</p>
<p>Then, not forgetting to use the data frame that we just made:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb102"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb102-1"><a href="matched-pairs-t-and-sign-test.html#cb102-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(bodyfat2, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> diff)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-72-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This is showing a little evidence of skewness or outliers (depending
on your point of view: either is good). The lowest and highest values
are both too high, and the pattern of points on the plot is kind of
curved (which would be evidence of skewness). Or you could say that
the two highest values are too high, with the other values being more
or less in line (that would be evidence of outliers at the upper
end). I like outliers better than skewness, since those bottom-end
points are not far off the line. I would also accept
“no substantial problems”,
if you can make the case that those two highest points are
not too far off the line. With only 16 observations as we have here,
even truly normal data would stray off the line a bit.</p>
<p>As ever, your explanation is more important than your conclusion. Can
you justify what you think?</p>
<p>If you took your differences the other way around, as
<code>ultrasound</code> minus <code>xray</code>, your plot will also be the
other way around, with the “outliers” at the bottom. That’s good
too.</p>

<li>Previously, we did a matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test for these data. In
the light of your normal quantile plot, do you think that was a good
idea? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>We are looking for the differences to be approximately normal,
bearing in mind that we have a sample of size 16, which is not
that large. Say what you think here; the points, if I were giving
any here, would be for the way in which you support it.
The comment I made before when we did a matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test
was that the P-value was so large and non-significant that it was
hard to imagine any other test giving a significant
result. Another way of saying that is that I considered these
differences to be “normal enough”, given the circumstances.
You might very well take a different view. You could say that
these differences are clearly not normal, and that the sample size
of 16 is not large enough to get any substantial help from the
Central Limit Theorem. From that point of view, running the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is clearly not advisable.</p>

<li>Use the sign test appropriately to compare the two methods for
measuring body fat. (Use <code>smmr</code> if you wish.) What do you
conclude, as ever in the context of the data?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>That means using a sign test to test the null hypothesis that the
median difference is zero, against the alternative that it is not
zero. (I don’t see anything here to indicate that we are looking only
for positive or only for negative differences, so I think two-sided is
right. You need some reason to do a one-sided test, and there isn’t
one here.)</p>
<p>Remembering again to use the data frame that has the differences in it:</p>

## 3   two-sided 0.4544983</code></pre>
<p>The two-sided P-value is 0.4545, so we are nowhere near rejecting the
null hypothesis that the median difference is zero. There is no
evidence that the two methods for measuring body fat show any
difference on average.</p>
<p>The table of aboves and belows says that there were 6 positive
differences and 10 negative ones. This is not far from an even split,
so the lack of significance is entirely what we would expect.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.13</span> The dentist and blood pressure</h2>
<p>Going to the dentist is scary for a lot of people. One way in which this might show up is that people might have higher blood pressure on average before their dentist’s appointment than an hour after the appointment is done. Ten randomly-chosen individuals have their (systolic) blood pressure measured while they are in a dentist’s waiting room, and then again one hour after their appointment is finished.</p>

<p>Aside: A blood pressure is usually given as two numbers, like ``120 over 80’’. The first number, which is the one shown in our data, is called the systolic blood pressure. It is the pressure in the arteries when the heart is pumping. The second is called the diastolic blood pressure, and it is the pressure in the arteries when the heart is resting.</p>

<li>What kind of experimental design is this? How do you know? Explain briefly.</li>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is a matched pairs design. We know this because we have two measurements on each person, or the same people were measured before and after seeing the dentist. (The thing that it is <em>not</em> is one group of people measured before seeing the dentist, and a <em>different</em> group of people measured afterwards, so a two-sample test is <em>not</em> the right thing.)</p>

<p>A matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, then. Remember, we want to see whether blood pressure is <em>lower</em> afterwards (that is, before is <em>greater</em> than after), so this needs to be one-sided:</p>

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Discuss briefly which of your two tests is the more appropriate one to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Make a call about whether the differences are normal enough. You have a couple of angles you can take:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lowest two values are too low, so we have two outliers at the low end</li>
<li>the lowest <em>and</em> highest values are too extreme, so that we have a long-tailed distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>Either of these would suggest a non-normal distribution, which I think you have to conclude from this plot.</p>
<p>The best answer also considers the sample size: there are only 10 differences, a small sample size, and so we will not get much help from the Central Limit Theorem (the sample size is likely not enough<label for="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">7</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">7</span> But see the Extra.</span> to overcome those two outliers or the long tails). Thus, we should <em>not</em> trust the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test and should prefer the sign test.</p>
<p>Extra: you might be disappointed to go through this and come to the conclusion that there was not a decrease in blood pressure between before and after.</p>
<p>What has happened, I think, is that we have only a small sample (10 people), and having 8 positive differences and 2 negative ones is not quite unbalanced enough (with such a small sample) to rule out chance: that is to say, a median difference of zero. The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test accounted for the size of the differences, and if you believed the normality was satisfactory, you could demonstrate a difference between before and after. But if you didn’t like the normality, you were out of luck: the only test you have is an apparently not very powerful one.</p>
<p>If you wanted to, you could bootstrap the sampling distribution of the sample mean and see how normal it looks:</p>

<p>(Code note: you can do anything with the result of a simulation, and you can use anything that might need to be normal as input to a normal quantile plot. Now that we have the normal quantile plot as a tool, we can use it wherever it might be helpful.)</p>
<p>This is actually not nearly as bad as I was expecting. Even a sample size of 10 is providing some help. The bootstrapped sampling distribution is somewhat left-skewed, which is not a surprise given the two low outliers. However, it is rather close to normal, suggesting that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is not as bad as we thought.</p>
<p>(I did 10,000 simulations because I was having trouble seeing how non-normal it was. With this many, I can be pretty sure that this distribution is somewhat left-skewed.)</p>

<p>Twenty high-school French teachers attended a summer institute to improve their French skills. At the beginning of their session, each teacher took a listening test (to test their understanding of spoken French). After 4 weeks of immersion in French, each teacher took a similar listening test again. (The actual French spoken in the two tests was different, so simply taking the first test should not improve the score in the second one; the tests were otherwise similar.) The maximum score on each test was 36, and a higher score is better. The data are <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/frenchtest.txt">here</a>.

Or, if it were two independent samples, our 40 measurements would come from 40 different teachers, but there are only 20 teachers, so the 40 measurements must be paired up.</p>

<p>Your choice between these two might be influenced by whether you think <code>pre</code> comes first, or whether you think it’s easier to decide how <code>post</code> compares to <code>pre</code>. It’s all down to what seems natural to you.</p>

<p>This last is an ordinary one-sample test, which saves you having to learn anything new, but requires you to calculate the differences first. You will need the differences for a plot anyway, so this may not be as much extra work as it appears. The right thing to do here is to <em>save</em> the data frame with the differences in it, so that you don’t need to calculate them again later.</p>
<p>A fourth alternative is to calculate the differences as <code>pre</code> minus <code>post</code>, and then switch the <code>alternative</code> around (since if going to the French institute helps, the differences this way will be mostly <em>negative</em>):</p>

<p>The P-value of 0.0005 is much less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis that the mean scores before and after are the same, in favour of the alternative that the mean score afterwards is higher.

<p>Solution</p>
<p>A 95% (or other level) confidence interval for the mean difference. A one-sided test doesn’t give that, so you need to do the test again without the <code>alternative</code> (to make it two-sided), via any of the methods above, such as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb128"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb128-1"><a href="matched-pairs-t-and-sign-test.html#cb128-1"></a><span class="kw">with</span>(french, <span class="kw">t.test</span>(post, pre, <span class="dt">paired =</span> T))</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This says that, with 95% confidence, the mean test score afterwards is between about 1.1 and 3.9 points higher than before. So that’s how much listening skill is improving on average. Give the suitably rounded interval; the test scores are whole numbers, and there are 20 differences making up the mean, so one decimal is the most you should give.</p>
<p>If you did it the first way:</p>

<p>you have given yourself a bit of work to do, because this is before minus after, so you have to strip off the minus signs and switch the numbers around. Giving the answer with the minus signs is wrong, because I didn’t ask about before minus after. Disentangle it, though, and you’re good.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>The key assumption here is that the <em>differences</em> are approximately normally distributed.</p>
<p>First calculate <em>and save</em> the differences (since you will need them later for a sign test; otherwise you would have to find them again). If you found the differences to make your <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, use the ones you saved there.</p>

<li>Do you trust the result of your matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>There are about three considerations here:</p>
<ul>
<li>the plot shows an outlier at the low end, but no other real problems.</li>
<li>the sample size is 20, so we should get some help from the Central Limit Theorem.</li>
<li>the P-value was really small.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect you to mention the first two of those. Make a call about whether you think that outlier is too much of a problem, given the sample size. You could, I think, go either way with this one.</p>
<p>The third of my points says that even if the distribution of differences is not normal enough, and so the P-value is off by a bit, it would take a lot to change it enough to stop it being significant. So I don’t think we need to worry, for myself.</p>
<p>Extra:</p>
<p>We can assess the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test by obtaining a bootstrap distribution of the sample mean, by sampling from the differences with replacement:</p>

<p>The bootstrapped sampling distribution of the sample mean difference is about as normal as you could reasonably wish for, so there was no need to worry. Only a very few of the most extreme samples were at all off the line.</p>
<p>A histogram would be almost as good, but now that you know about the normal quantile plot, the time to use it is when you are <em>specifically</em> interested in normality, as you are here. (If you were interested in shape generally, then a histogram or, if appropriate, a boxplot, would also work.)</p>
<p>The code: the first line takes 1000 bootstrap samples, and the second finds the mean of each one. Instead of saving the sample means, since I was only going to be using them once, I made them into a dataframe, and then made a normal quantile plot of them. The <code>enframe</code> creates a dataframe with a column called <code>value</code> with the means in it, which I use in the plot.</p>

<p>The P-value is 0.00014, again very small, saying that the median difference is greater than zero, that is, that the test scores after are greater than the test scores before on average. The confidence interval is from 1 to 3 points, indicating that this is how much test scores are increasing on average.</p>
<p>A technique thing: the first time you are going through this, you probably got to this point and realized that you were calculating the differences for the second (or third) time. This is the place to stop and think that you don’t really need to do that, and to go back to the plot you did and <em>save</em> the differences after you have calculated them. Then you edit the code here to use the differences you got before and saved. It doesn’t matter whether you see this the first time you do it or not, but it does matter that you see it before you hand it in. It’s like editing an essay; you need to go back through work that you will be handing in and make sure you did it the best way you could.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Comment briefly on the comparison between your inferences for the mean and the median.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The upper-tail P-value is 0.0001, in the same ballpark as the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test (0.0005). The 95% confidence interval for the median difference is from 1 to 3,<label for="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">8</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">8</span> I think I mentioned elsewhere that the P-value of the sign test, as it depends on the null median for a fixed data set, only changes at a data point. Therefore, the ends of a CI for the median must be data points.</span> again much like the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-interval (1.1 to 3.9).</p>
<p>This suggests that it doesn’t matter much which test we do, and therefore that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test ought to be better because it uses the data better.<label for="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">9</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">9</span> It uses the actual data values, not just whether each one is positive or negative.</span> This is more evidence that the outlier didn’t have that big of an effect.</p>
<p>Extra: choosing a test on the basis of its P-value is <em>wrong</em>, because as soon as you introduce a choice on that basis, your P-value looks lower than it should; a P-value is based on you doing one test and only that one test. It is reasonable to note, as I did, that the two P-values are about the same and then choose between the tests on <em>some other basis</em>, such as that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test uses the data better.<label for="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">10</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-10" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">10</span> If the P-values had come out very different, that would be telling you that it matters which one you use, and you would need to go back and look at your plot to decide. Often, this happens when there is something wrong with the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, but not necessarily.</span></p>
