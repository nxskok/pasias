</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The data file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>
athlete xray ultrasound
1 5.00 4.75
2 7 3.75
3 9.25 9
4 12 11.75

14 14 15.5
15 17 18
16 18 18.25
</code></pre>
<p>The data are two measurements for each of the 16 athletes: that
is, each athlete had their body fat percentage measured using
<em>both</em> of the two methods.
Extra: a two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> approach would be reasonable if one set of 16
athletes had been measured by X-ray and <em>another different</em>
set of 16 athletes had been measured by ultrasound. (That is, if
there had been 32 athletes in total, with each one randomly
assigned to <em>one</em> of the measurement methods.) But that’s not
what happened. It is easy to measure one athlete’s body fat
percentage using both of the two methods, so a matched pairs
design is easy to implement (as well as being better). If you use
two independent samples (each athlete doing only one measurement
method), you introduce an extra source of variability: athletes
differ one from another in body fat, as well as differing possibly
by measurement method. If you use a matched-pairs design, you
remove the athlete-to-athlete differences, leaving only the
differences due to measurement method.</p>

Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The smoothest<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
way to do this is to
use a pipeline: use a <code>mutate</code> to create the column of
differences, and then pipe that into <code>ggplot</code>, omitting the
data frame that would normally go first (the input data frame here
is the new one with the differences in it, which doesn’t have a
name). I’ll make a normal quantile plot in a moment, but if you
haven’t seen that yet, the plot to make is a histogram:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-1" title="1">bodyfat <span class="op">%&gt;%</span></a>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/bodyfat-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I don’t know whether you’d call that “approximately normal” or
not. We are in kind of a double-bind with this one: the sample size is
small, so normality matters, but with a small sample, the data might
not look very normal. It’s kind of skewed right, but most of the
evidence for the skewness is contained in those two observations with
difference 2 and above, which is pretty flimsy evidence for
anything. (In the normal quantile plot below, the suggestion is that
those two observations really are a bit too large. It’s easier to tell
there.)</p>
<p>Below, I’m repeating the calculation of the differences, which is
inefficient. If I’m going to draw two graphs of the differences, the
right way is to calculate the differences <em>and save the data
frame</em>, then use that new data frame twice. But you’re probably only
going to draw either the histogram or the normal quantile plot, not
both, so you can use the appropriate one of my two bits of code. The
normal quantile plot:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb56-1" title="1">bodyfat <span class="op">%&gt;%</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb56-2" title="2"><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(<span class="dt">diff =</span> xray <span class="op">-</span><span class="st"> </span>ultrasound) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb56-3" title="3"><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(<span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> diff)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/bodyfat-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This is showing a little evidence of skewness or outliers (depending
on your point of view: either is good). The lowest and highest values
are both too high, and the pattern of points on the plot is kind of
curved (which would be evidence of skewness). Or you could say that
the two highest values are too high, with the other values being more
or less in line (that would be evidence of outliers at the upper
end). I like outliers better than skewness, since those bottom-end
points are not far off the line. I would also accept
“no substantial problems”,
if you can make the case that those two highest points are
not too far off the line. With only 16 observations as we have here,
even truly normal data would stray off the line a bit.</p>
<p>As ever, your explanation is more important than your conclusion. Can
you justify what you think?</p>
<p>If you took your differences the other way around, as
<code>ultrasound</code> minus <code>xray</code>, your plot will also be the
other way around, with the “outliers” at the bottom. That’s good
too.</p>
<p>Where this is going (which I didn’t ask you) is whether or not we
trust the result of the matched pairs test. I would say that the test
is so far from being significant, and the failure of normality is not
gross, that it is hard to imagine <em>any</em> alternative test coming
up with a significant result. So I would be happy to trust this paired

the columns. Or you can put <code>col_names=F</code> and leave the

<p>Solution</p>
<p>I think using <code>smmr</code> is way easier, so I’ll do that
first. There is even a shortcut in that the null median defaults to
zero, which is exactly what we want here:</p>

<p>We want, this time, the upper-tailed one-sided test, since we want to
prove that students can throw a baseball a <em>longer</em> distance
than a softball. Thus the P-value we want is 0.000033.</p>
<p>To build it yourself, you know the steps by now.
First step is to count how many differences are greater and less than zero:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-1" title="1"><span class="kw">table</span>(throws2<span class="op">$</span>diff<span class="op">&gt;</span><span class="dv">0</span>)</a></code></pre></div>

<pre><code>## 
## FALSE  TRUE 
##    22     2</code></pre>
<p>or, since we have things in a data frame,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb68"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb68-1" title="1">throws2 <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">count</span>(diff<span class="op">&gt;</span><span class="dv">0</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   `diff &gt; 0`     n
##   &lt;lgl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;
## 1 FALSE          3
## 2 TRUE          21</code></pre>
<p>or count those less than zero. I’d take any of those.</p>
<p>Note that these are <em>not all the same</em>. One of the differences is
in fact exactly zero. The technically right thing to do with the zero
difference is to throw it away (leaving 23 differences with 2 negative
and 21 positive). I would take that, or 2 or 3 negative differences
out of 24 (depending on whether you count “greater than zero” or
“less than zero”). We hope that this won’t make a material
difference to the P-value; it’ll make some difference, but won’t (we
hope) change the conclusion about whether to reject.</p>
<p>Second step is to get a P-value for whichever one of those you got,
from the appropriate binomial distribution.</p>
<p>The P-value is the probability of getting 21 (or 22) positive
differences out of 24 (or 23) or more, since this is the end of the
distribution we should be at if the alternative hypothesis is correct.
Thus any of these will get you a defensible P-value:</p>

<p>The first and fourth of those are the same as <code>smmr</code> (throwing
away the exactly-median value).</p>
<p>As we hoped, there is no <em>material</em> difference here: there is no

difference of zero in favour of a median difference greater than
zero.</p>

<p>The rest of the way, we are trying to reproduce that confidence

The function is called <code>pval_sign</code>. If you haven’t run into it
before, in R Studio click on Packages, find <code>smmr</code>, and
click on its name. This will bring up package help, which
includes a list of all the functions in the package, along with
a brief description of what each one does. (Clicking
on a function name brings up the help for that function.)
Let’s check that it works properly by repeating the previous

the same thing:</p>

the median difference is not zero.</p>

<li>Based on your P-value, do you think 0 is inside the confidence

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Absolutely not. The median difference is definitely not
zero, so zero cannot be in the confidence interval.
Our suspicion, from the one-sided test from earlier, is that
the differences were mostly positive (people could throw a
baseball farther than a softball, in most cases). So the
confidence interval ought to contain only positive values.
I ask this because it drives what happens below.</p>

<li>Obtain a 95% confidence interval for the population

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I’ve given you a fair bit of freedom to tackle this as you
wish. Anything that makes sense is good: whatever mixture of
mindlessness, guesswork and cleverness that you want to employ.
The most mindless way to try some values one at a time and see what
you get, eg.:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb92"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb92-1" title="1"><span class="kw">pval_sign</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, throws, diff)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.001489639</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb94"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb94-1" title="1"><span class="kw">pval_sign</span>(<span class="dv">5</span>, throws, diff)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.168188</code></pre>
<p>So median 1 is outside and median 5 is inside the 95% interval. Keep
trying values until you’ve figured out where the lower and upper ends
of the interval are: where the P-values cross from below 0.05 to
above, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Something more intelligent is to make a long list of potential
medians, and get the P-value for each of them, eg.:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb96"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb96-1" title="1">d &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">tibble</span>(<span class="dt">my.med =</span> <span class="kw">seq</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">20</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>))</a>

<p>The top end is 9, 9 being inside and 9.5 outside.</p>
<p>Since the data values are all whole numbers, I think this is accurate enough.
The most sophisticated way is the “bisection” idea we saw before. We
already have a kickoff for this, since we found, mindlessly, that 1 is
outside the interval on the low end and 5 is inside, so the lower
limit has to be between 1 and 5. Let’s try halfway between, ie. 3:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb102"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb102-1" title="1"><span class="kw">pval_sign</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>, throws, diff)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.3833103</code></pre>
<p>Inside, so lower limit is between 1 and 3. This can be automated, thus:</p>

<p>The difficult bit is to decide whether the value <code>try</code> becomes
the new <code>lo</code> or the new <code>hi</code>. If the P-value for the
median of <code>try</code> is greater than 0.05, <code>try</code> is inside
the interval, and it becomes the new <code>hi</code>; otherwise it’s
outside and becomes the new <code>lo</code>. Whatever the values are,
<code>lo</code> is always outside the interval and <code>hi</code> is always
inside, and they move closer and closer to each other.</p>
<p>At the other end of the interval, <code>lo</code> is inside and
<code>hi</code> is outside, so there is a little switching around within
the loop. For starting values, you can be fairly mindless: for
example, we know that 5 is inside and something big like 20 must be outside:</p>

<code>ci_median</code> uses the bisection method with a smaller “tolerance” than we
did, so its answer is more accurate. It looks as if the interval goes
from 2 to 9: that is, students can throw a baseball on average between

<p>There are 20 employees (rows), and two columns of salaries: for each
employee in the data set, their salary in January 2016 and in January
2017 (thus, two salaries for each employee).</p>

<li>To compare the salaries, explain briefly why a

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>A matched-pairs test would be better because we have two
observations (salaries) for each subject (employee). A two-sample
test would be appropriate if we had two separate sets of
employees, one set with their salaries recorded in 2016 and the
other with their salaries recorded in 2017. That is not what we
have here.
You can go after this either way: why a matched-pairs approach is
appropriate, or why a two-sample approach is not (or a bit of both).</p>

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This requires thought first before you do any coding (and this is
the reason for this one being four points). What has to be at
least approximately normally distributed is the set of
<em>differences</em>, salary at one time point minus the salary at
the other, for each employee. The individual salaries don’t have
to be normally distributed at all.
We don’t have the differences here, so we have to calculate them
first. The smoothest way is to make a pipeline:</p>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/salaryinc-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>A couple of coding notes: (i) you can take the differences 2016 minus
2017 if you like (then they will tend to be negative), (ii)
<code>ggplot</code> used in a pipeline like this does <em>not</em> have a
data frame first (the data frame used is the nameless output from the
<code>mutate</code>, with the differences in it).</p>
<p>Also, there’s no problem doing the <code>mutate</code>, saving that, and
then feeding the saved data frame into <code>ggplot</code>. If you find
that clearer, go for it.</p>
<p>As for what I see: I think those points get a bit far from the
line at the high and low ends: the high values are too high and the
low values are too low, which is to say that we have outliers at both
ends, or the distribution has long tails (either way of saying it is
good).</p>
<p>The important conclusion here is whether these differences are normal
<em>enough</em> to trust a matched pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test here. We have a sample
of size 20, so the central limit theorem will help us some, but you
can reasonably say that these tails are too long and that we should
not trust a matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test.</p>
<p>I actually wanted you to practice doing a matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test
anyway, hence my comment in the next part, but the result is probably
not <em>so</em> trustworthy.</p>

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The company is trying to prove that salaries are <em>increasing</em>
over time, so we need a one-sided alternative.
Following through the procedure, even though you may not trust it much:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb113"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb113-1" title="1"><span class="kw">with</span>(salaries, <span class="kw">t.test</span>(jan2016, jan2017, <span class="dt">alternative =</span> <span class="st">&quot;less&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">paired =</span> T))</a></code></pre></div>

##       -Inf -5.125252
## sample estimates:
## mean of the differences 
##                  -6.185</code></pre>
<p>You could also have the years the other way around, in which case the
alternative has to be the other way around as well:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb115"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb115-1" title="1"><span class="kw">with</span>(salaries, <span class="kw">t.test</span>(jan2017, jan2016, <span class="dt">alternative =</span> <span class="st">&quot;greater&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">paired =</span> T))</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##

<p>Or, if you saved the data frame with the differences in it, do a
one-sample test on those, again making sure that you get the

differences again:</p>

<p>(Your intuition ought to have expected something like this, because

<li>Calculate the differences, and make a normal quantile plot of

Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is a good place to look ahead. We’ll need the differences in two
places, most likely: first for the normal quantile plot, and second
for the matched-pairs sign test. So we should calculate and save them first:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb127"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb127-1" title="1">bodyfat <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(<span class="dt">diff =</span> xray <span class="op">-</span><span class="st"> </span>ultrasound) -&gt;<span class="st"> </span>bodyfat2</a></code></pre></div>
<p>I seem to be using a 2 on the end to name my
dataframe-with-differences, but you can use whatever name you like.</p>
<p>Then, not forgetting to use the data frame that we just made:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb128"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb128-1" title="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(bodyfat2, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> diff)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/bodyfat-sign-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This is showing a little evidence of skewness or outliers (depending
on your point of view: either is good). The lowest and highest values
are both too high, and the pattern of points on the plot is kind of
curved (which would be evidence of skewness). Or you could say that
the two highest values are too high, with the other values being more
or less in line (that would be evidence of outliers at the upper
end). I like outliers better than skewness, since those bottom-end
points are not far off the line. I would also accept
“no substantial problems”,
if you can make the case that those two highest points are
not too far off the line. With only 16 observations as we have here,
even truly normal data would stray off the line a bit.</p>
<p>As ever, your explanation is more important than your conclusion. Can
you justify what you think?</p>
<p>If you took your differences the other way around, as
<code>ultrasound</code> minus <code>xray</code>, your plot will also be the
other way around, with the “outliers” at the bottom. That’s good

<li>Previously, we did a matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test for these data. In

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>We are looking for the differences to be approximately normal,
bearing in mind that we have a sample of size 16, which is not
that large. Say what you think here; the points, if I were giving
any here, would be for the way in which you support it.
The comment I made before when we did a matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test
was that the P-value was so large and non-significant that it was
hard to imagine any other test giving a significant
result. Another way of saying that is that I considered these
differences to be “normal enough”, given the circumstances.
You might very well take a different view. You could say that
these differences are clearly not normal, and that the sample size
of 16 is not large enough to get any substantial help from the
Central Limit Theorem. From that point of view, running the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is clearly not advisable.</p>

<li>Use the sign test appropriately to compare the two methods for
measuring body fat. (Use <code>smmr</code> if you wish.) What do you
conclude, as ever in the context of the data?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>That means using a sign test to test the null hypothesis that the
median difference is zero, against the alternative that it is not
zero. (I don’t see anything here to indicate that we are looking only
for positive or only for negative differences, so I think two-sided is
right. You need some reason to do a one-sided test, and there isn’t
one here.)</p>
<p>Remembering again to use the data frame that has the differences in it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb129"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb129-1" title="1"><span class="kw">sign_test</span>(bodyfat2, diff, <span class="dv">0</span>)</a></code></pre></div>

## 2       upper 0.8949432
## 3   two-sided 0.4544983</code></pre>
<p>The two-sided P-value is 0.4545, so we are nowhere near rejecting the
null hypothesis that the median difference is zero. There is no
evidence that the two methods for measuring body fat show any
difference on average.</p>
<p>The table of aboves and belows says that there were 6 positive
differences and 10 negative ones. This is not far from an even split,
so the lack of significance is entirely what we would expect.</p>
<p>Extra: this is the same conclusion that we drew the last time we
looked at these data (with a matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test). That supports
what I said then, which is that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test was so far from being
significant, that it could be very wrong without changing the
conclusion. That is what seems to have happened.</p>

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Discuss briefly which of your two tests is the more appropriate one to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Make a call about whether the differences are normal enough. You have a couple of angles you can take:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lowest two values are too low, so we have two outliers at the low end</li>
<li>the lowest <em>and</em> highest values are too extreme, so that we have a long-tailed distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>Either of these would suggest a non-normal distribution, which I think you have to conclude from this plot.</p>
<p>The best answer also considers the sample size: there are only 10 differences, a small sample size, and so we will not get much help from the Central Limit Theorem (the sample size is likely not enough<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> to overcome those two outliers or the long tails). Thus, we should <em>not</em> trust the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test and should prefer the sign test.</p>
<p>Extra: you might be disappointed to go through this and come to the conclusion that there was not a decrease in blood pressure between before and after.</p>
<p>What has happened, I think, is that we have only a small sample (10 people), and having 8 positive differences and 2 negative ones is not quite unbalanced enough (with such a small sample) to rule out chance: that is to say, a median difference of zero. The <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test accounted for the size of the differences, and if you believed the normality was satisfactory, you could demonstrate a difference between before and after. But if you didn’t like the normality, you were out of luck: the only test you have is an apparently not very powerful one.</p>
<p>If you wanted to, you could bootstrap the sampling distribution of the sample mean and see how normal it looks:</p>

<p>(Code note: you can do anything with the result of a simulation, and you can use anything that might need to be normal as input to a normal quantile plot. Now that we have the normal quantile plot as a tool, we can use it wherever it might be helpful.)</p>
<p>This is actually not nearly as bad as I was expecting. Even a sample size of 10 is providing some help. The bootstrapped sampling distribution is somewhat left-skewed, which is not a surprise given the two low outliers. However, it is rather close to normal, suggesting that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is not as bad as we thought.</p>
<p>(I did 10,000 simulations because I was having trouble seeing how non-normal it was. With this many, I can be pretty sure that this distribution is somewhat left-skewed.)</p>

<p>This last is an ordinary one-sample test, which saves you having to learn anything new, but requires you to calculate the differences first. You will need the differences for a plot anyway, so this may not be as much extra work as it appears. The right thing to do here is to <em>save</em> the data frame with the differences in it, so that you don’t need to calculate them again later.</p>
<p>A fourth alternative is to calculate the differences as <code>pre</code> minus <code>post</code>, and then switch the <code>alternative</code> around (since if going to the French institute helps, the differences this way will be mostly <em>negative</em>):</p>

<li>What do you conclude from your test, in the context of the data?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The P-value of 0.0005 is much less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis that the mean scores before and after are the same, in favour of the alternative that the mean score afterwards is higher. That is to say, the four-week program is helping the teachers improve their understanding of spoken French.</p>

<li>How much is the teachers’ listening skill improving, on average? Give a suitable interval to support your answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>A 95% (or other level) confidence interval for the mean difference. A one-sided test doesn’t give that, so you need to do the test again without the <code>alternative</code> (to make it two-sided), via any of the methods above, such as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb157"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb157-1" title="1"><span class="kw">with</span>(french, <span class="kw">t.test</span>(post, pre, <span class="dt">paired =</span> T))</a></code></pre></div>

## sample estimates:
## mean of the differences

<p>This says that, with 95% confidence, the mean test score afterwards is between about 1.1 and 3.9 points higher than before. So that’s how much listening skill is improving on average. Give the suitably rounded interval; the test scores are whole numbers, and there are 20 differences making up the mean, so one decimal is the most you should give.</p>
<p>If you did it the first way:</p>

<p>you have given yourself a bit of work to do, because this is before minus after, so you have to strip off the minus signs and switch the numbers around. Giving the answer with the minus signs is wrong, because I didn’t ask about before minus after. Disentangle it, though, and you’re good.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>The key assumption here is that the <em>differences</em> are approximately normally distributed.</p>
<p>First calculate <em>and save</em> the differences (since you will need them later for a sign test; otherwise you would have to find them again). If you found the differences to make your <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, use the ones you saved there.</p>

(note that the horizontal lines of points are because the test scores were whole numbers, therefore the differences between them are whole numbers also, and some of the teachers had the same difference in scores as others.)</p>

<li>Do you trust the result of your matched-pairs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>There are about three considerations here:</p>
<ul>
<li>the plot shows an outlier at the low end, but no other real problems.</li>
<li>the sample size is 20, so we should get some help from the Central Limit Theorem.</li>
<li>the P-value was really small.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect you to mention the first two of those. Make a call about whether you think that outlier is too much of a problem, given the sample size. You could, I think, go either way with this one.</p>
<p>The third of my points says that even if the distribution of differences is not normal enough, and so the P-value is off by a bit, it would take a lot to change it enough to stop it being significant. So I don’t think we need to worry, for myself.</p>
<p>Extra:</p>
<p>We can assess the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test by obtaining a bootstrap distribution of the sample mean, by sampling from the differences with replacement:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb164"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb164-1" title="1"><span class="kw">tibble</span>(<span class="dt">sim =</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">1000</span>) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></a>

<p><img src="pasias_files/figure-html/french-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The bootstrapped sampling distribution of the sample mean difference is about as normal as you could reasonably wish for, so there was no need to worry. Only a very few of the most extreme samples were at all off the line.</p>
<p>A histogram would be almost as good, but now that you know about the normal quantile plot, the time to use it is when you are <em>specifically</em> interested in normality, as you are here. (If you were interested in shape generally, then a histogram or, if appropriate, a boxplot, would also work.)</p>
<p>The code: the first line takes 1000 bootstrap samples, and the second finds the mean of each one. Instead of saving the sample means, since I was only going to be using them once, I made them into a dataframe, and then made a normal quantile plot of them. The <code>enframe</code> creates a dataframe with a column called <code>value</code> with the means in it, which I use in the plot.</p>

<p>The P-value is 0.00014, again very small, saying that the median difference is greater than zero, that is, that the test scores after are greater than the test scores before on average. The confidence interval is from 1 to 3 points, indicating that this is how much test scores are increasing on average.</p>
<p>A technique thing: the first time you are going through this, you probably got to this point and realized that you were calculating the differences for the second (or third) time. This is the place to stop and think that you don’t really need to do that, and to go back to the plot you did and <em>save</em> the differences after you have calculated them. Then you edit the code here to use the differences you got before and saved. It doesn’t matter whether you see this the first time you do it or not, but it does matter that you see it before you hand it in. It’s like editing an essay; you need to go back through work that you will be handing in and make sure you did it the best way you could.</p>

<li>Comment briefly on the comparison between your inferences for the mean and the median.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The upper-tail P-value is 0.0001, in the same ballpark as the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test (0.0005). The 95% confidence interval for the median difference is from 1 to 3,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> again much like the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-interval (1.1 to 3.9).</p>
<p>This suggests that it doesn’t matter much which test we do, and therefore that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test ought to be better because it uses the data better.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This is more evidence that the outlier didn’t have that big of an effect.</p>
<p>Extra: choosing a test on the basis of its P-value is <em>wrong</em>, because as soon as you introduce a choice on that basis, your P-value looks lower than it should; a P-value is based on you doing one test and only that one test. It is reasonable to note, as I did, that the two P-values are about the same and then choose between the tests on <em>some other basis</em>, such as that the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test uses the data better.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
