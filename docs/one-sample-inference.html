<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Hunter-gatherers in Australia</h2>
<p>A hunter-gatherer society is one where people get their food
by hunting, fishing or foraging rather than by agriculture or by
raising animals. Such societies tend to move from place to place.
Anthropologists have studied hunter-gatherer societies in forest
ecosystems across the world. The average population density of these
societies is 7.38 people per 100 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. Hunter-gatherer societies on
different continents might have different population densities,
possibly because of large-scale ecological constraints (such as
resource availability), or because of other factors, possibly social
and/or historic, determining population density.</p>
<p>Some hunter-gatherer societies in Australia were studied, and the
population density per 100 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> recorded for each. The data are in
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/hg.txt">http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/hg.txt</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Read the data into R. Do you have the correct variables?

</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The data values are separated by (single) spaces, so <code>read_delim</code>
is the thing:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb230"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb230-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb230-1"></a>url=<span class="st">&quot;http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/hg.txt&quot;</span></span>

## )</code></pre>
<p>I like to put the URL in a variable first, because if I don’t, the
<code>read_delim</code> line can be rather long. But if you want to do it
in one step, that’s fine, as long as it’s clear that you are doing the
right thing.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the data frame:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb232"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb232-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb232-1"></a>societies</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I have the name of each society and its population density, as
promised (so that is correct). There were 13 societies that were
studied. For me, they were all displayed. For you, you’ll probably see only the first ten, and you’ll have to click Next to see the last three.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The question of interest is whether these Australian
hunter-gatherer societies are like the rest of the world in terms of mean
population density. State suitable null and alternative
hypotheses. <em>Define any symbols you use</em>: that is, if you use a
symbol, you also have to say what it means.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The mean for the world as a whole (“average”, as stated earlier)
is 7.38. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> denote the population mean for Australia (of
which these societies are a sample). Then our hypotheses are:
<span class="math display">\[ H_0: \mu=7.38\]</span>
and
<span class="math display">\[ H_a: \mu \ne 7.38.\]</span>
There is no reason for a one-sided alternative here, since all we
are interested in is whether Australia is different from the rest
of the world.
<em>Expect to lose a point</em> if you use the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> without
saying what it means.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Test your hypotheses using a suitable test. What do you
conclude, in the context of the data?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>A <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, since we are testing a mean:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb234"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb234-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb234-1"></a><span class="kw">t.test</span>(societies<span class="op">$</span>density,<span class="dt">mu=</span><span class="fl">7.38</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## 
## 	One Sample t-test
## 
## data:  societies$density
## t = 3.8627, df = 12, p-value = 0.002257
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 7.38
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  15.59244 36.84449
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
##  26.21846</code></pre>
<p>The P-value is 0.0023, less than the usual <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of 0.05, so we
<em>reject</em> the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean
population density is not equal to 7.38. That is to say, Australia is
different from the rest of the world in this sense.</p>
<p>As you know, “reject the null hypothesis” is only part of the
answer, so gets only part of the marks.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Do you have any doubts about the validity of your test?
Explain briefly, using a suitable graph to support your
explanation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The assumption behind the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is that the data are
approximately normal. We can assess that in several ways, but the
simplest (which is perfectly acceptable at this point) is a
histogram. You’ll need to pick a suitable number of bins. This one
comes from Sturges’ rule:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb236"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb236-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb236-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(societies,<span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span>density))<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins=</span><span class="dv">5</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="04-one-sample-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672"  />
Your conclusion might depend on how many bins you chose for your
histogram. Here’s 8 bins (which is really too many with only 13
observations, but it actually shows the shape well):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb237"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb237-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb237-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(societies,<span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span>density))<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_histogram</span>(<span class="dt">bins=</span><span class="dv">8</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="04-one-sample-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>or you can get a number of bins from one of the built-in functions,
such as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb238"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb238-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb238-1"></a>mybins=<span class="kw">nclass.FD</span>(societies<span class="op">$</span>density)</span>
<span id="cb238-2"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb238-2"></a>mybins</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>This one is small. The interquartile range is large and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is small,
so the binwidth will be large and therefore the number of bins will be
small.</p>
<p>Other choices: a one-group boxplot:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb240"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb240-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb240-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(societies,<span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x=</span><span class="dv">1</span>,<span class="dt">y=</span>density))<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">geom_boxplot</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="04-one-sample-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This isn’t the best for assessing normality as such, but it will tell
you about lack of symmetry and outliers, which are the most important
threats to the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, so it’s fine here. Or, a normal quantile plot:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb241"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb241-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb241-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(societies,<span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample=</span>density))<span class="op">+</span></span>
<span id="cb241-2"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb241-2"></a><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>()<span class="op">+</span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="04-one-sample-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This is actually the best way to assess normality, but I’m not
expecting you to use this plot here, because we may not have gotten to
it in class yet. (If you have read ahead and successfully use the
plot, it’s fine.)</p>
<p>After you have drawn your chosen plot (you need <em>one</em> plot), you
need to say something about normality and thus whether you have any
doubts about the validity of your <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. This will depend on the
graph you drew: if you think your graph is symmetric and outlier-free,
you should have no doubts about your <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test; if you think it has
something wrong with it, you should say what it is and express your
doubts. My guess is that you will think this distribution is skewed to
the right. Most of my plots are saying that.
<label for="tufte-mn-14" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-14" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">The normal quantile plot is rather interesting: it says that the uppermost values are approximately normal, but the <em>smallest</em> eight or so values are too bunched up to be normal. That is, normality fails not because of the long tail on the right, but the bunching on the left. Still right-skewed, though.</span></p>
<p>On the website where I got these data, they were using the data as
an example for another test, precisely <em>because</em> they thought the
distribution was right-skewed. Later on, we’ll learn about the sign
test for the median, which I think is actually a better test here.</p>

and then find the file you saved.
Also, there is only one column, so you can pretend that there

<p>Using <code>read_delim</code> with any delimiter (such as <code>" "</code>)
will also work, and is thus also good.</p>
<p>Variable names in R can have a dot (or an underscore, but not a space)
in them. I have grown accustomed to using dots to separate words. This
works in R but not other languages, but is seen by some as
old-fashioned, with underscores being the modern way.
<label for="tufte-mn-15" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-15" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">In some languages, a dot is used to concatenate bits of text, or as a way of calling a method on an object. But in R, a dot has no special meaning, and is used in function names like <em>t.test</em>. Or <em>read.table</em>. </span>
You can also use what is called “camel case”
by starting each “word” after the first with an uppercase
letter like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb246"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb246-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb246-1"></a>journeyTimes &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">read_csv</span>(my_url)</span></code></pre></div>

no matter what they’re called. In any of the cases above, there is no
variable called <code>journeytimes</code>. As Jenny Bryan (in

<p>We are testing that the mean journey time is 60 minutes, against the
two-sided alternative (default) that the mean is not equal to 60 minutes. The
P-value, 0.1971, is a lot bigger than the usual <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of 0.05, so we cannot
reject the null hypothesis. That is, there is no evidence that the
mean journey time differs from 60 minutes.</p>
<p>As you remember, we have not proved that the mean journey time
<em>is</em> 60 minutes, which is what “accepting the null hypothesis”
would be. We have only failed to reject it, in a shoulder-shrugging
kind of way: “the mean journey time <em>could</em> be 60 minutes”. The
other acceptable word is “retain”; when you say “we retain the null hypothesis”, you imply something
like “we act as if the mean is 60 minutes, at least until we find something better.”</p>

the interval of plausible values for the population mean, which

<p>The assumption behind the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is that the population from which
the data come has a normal distribution: ie. symmetric with no
outliers. A small sample (here we have 11 values) even from a normal
distribution might look quite non-normal (as in Assignment 0 from last
week), so I am not hugely concerned by this boxplot. However, it’s
perfectly all right to say that this distribution is skewed, and
therefore we should doubt the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, because the upper whisker is
longer than the lower one. In fact, the topmost value is very nearly
an outlier:

<p>and there might be skewness as well, so maybe I should have been concerned.</p>
<p>I would be looking for some intelligent comment on the boxplot: what it
looks like vs. what it ought to look like. I don’t so much mind what
that comment is, as long as it’s intelligent enough.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should draw a normal quantile plot:</p>

<p><img src="04-one-sample-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The normal quantile plot is saying that the problem is actually at the
<em>bottom</em> of the distribution: the lowest value is not low enough,
but the highest value is actually <em>not</em> too high. So this one
seems to be on the edge between OK and being right-skewed (too bunched
up at the bottom). My take is that with this small sample this is not
too bad. But you are free to disagree.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the normality, you’d use a <em>sign test</em> and test
that the <em>median</em> is not 60 minutes, which you would (at my
guess) utterly fail to reject:</p>

<p>There is an annoyance about <code>t.test</code>. Sometimes you can use
<code>data=</code> with it, and sometimes not. When we do a two-sample
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test later, there is a “model formula” with a squiggle in it,
and there we can use <code>data=</code>, but here not, so you have to use
the dollar sign or the <code>with</code> to say which data frame to get
things from. The distinction seems to be that , you can use <code>data=</code>, and if not, not.</p>
<p>This is one of those things that is a consequence of R’s history. The
original <code>t.test</code> was without the model formula and thus
without the <code>data=</code>, but the model formula got “retro-fitted”
to it later. Since the model formula comes from things like
regression, where <code>data=</code> is legit, that had to be retro-fitted
as well. Or, at least, that’s my understanding.</p>

<p>“Reject the null hypothesis” is <em>not</em> a complete answer. You

<p>So, we were assessing normality. What about that?</p>
<p>It is mostly normal-looking, but I am suspicious about those
<em>very</em> low birth weights, the ones below about 4 pounds. There
are too many of those, as I see it.</p>
<p>If you think this is approximately normal, you need to make some
comment along the lines of “the shape is approximately symmetric with no outliers”.
I think my first answer is better, but this answer is
worth something, since it is a not completely unreasonable
interpretation of the histogram.</p>
<p>A normal quantile plot is better for assessing normality
than a histogram is, but I won’t make you do one until we have seen
the idea in class. Here’s the normal quantile plot for these data:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb265"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb265-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb265-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(bw, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">sample =</span> <span class="st">`</span><span class="dt">Weight (pounds)</span><span class="st">`</span>)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stat_qq_line</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="04-one-sample-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>This is rather striking: the lowest birthweights (the ones below 5
pounds or so) are <em>way</em> too low for a normal distribution to
apply. The top end is fine (except perhaps for that one very heavy
baby), but there are too many low birthweights for a normal
distribution to be believable. Note how much clearer this story is
than on the histogram.</p>
<p>Having said that, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, especially with a sample size as big
as this (500), behaves <em>very</em> well when the data are somewhat
non-normal (because it takes advantage of the Central Limit Theorem:
that is, it’s the <em>sampling distribution of the sample mean</em>
whose shape matters). So, even though the data are definitely not
normal, I wouldn’t be too worried about our test.</p>
<p>This perhaps gives some insight as to why Freedman-Diaconis said we
should use so many bins for our histogram. We have a lot of low-end
outliers, so that the IQR is actually <em>small</em> compared to the
overall spread of the data (as measured, say, by the SD or the range)
and so FD thinks we need a lot of bins to describe the shape. Sturges
is based on data being approximately normal, so it will tend to
produce a small number of bins for data that have outliers.</p>

any other <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> you might have chosen). So we <em>reject</em> the
null hypothesis, and conclude that the mean <code>JulianDate</code> is actually
<em>less</em> than 130.</p>
<p>Now, this is the date on which the ice breaks up on average, and we
have concluded that it is <em>earlier</em> than it used to be, since we
are assuming the old-timer’s memory is correct.</p>
<p>This is evidence in
favour of global warming; a small piece of evidence, to be sure, but
the ice is melting earlier than it used to all over the Arctic, so
it’s not just in Nenana that it is happening. You don’t need to get to
the “global warming” part, but I <em>do</em> want you to observe that
the ice is breaking up earlier than it used to.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Plot <code>JulianDate</code> against <code>Year</code> on a

briefly. (You did this before, but I have some extra comments on
the graph this time, so feel free to just read this part.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>I liked the <code>ggplot</code> with a smooth trend on it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb272"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb272-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb272-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(nenana, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> Year, <span class="dt">y =</span> JulianDate)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="04-one-sample-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>There was something obvious to see: after about 1960, there is a clear
downward trend: the ice is breaking up earlier on average every
year. Even though there is a lot of variability, the overall trend,
viewed this way, is clear (and consistent with the test we did
earlier). Note that the old-timer’s value of 130 is the kind of
<code>JulianDate</code> we would typically observe around 1920, which
would make the old-timer over 90 years old.</p>
<p>All right, why did I say I had some doubts earlier? Well, because of
this downward trend, the mean is not actually the same all the way
through, so it doesn’t make all that much sense to estimate it, which
is what we were doing earlier by doing a confidence interval or a
hypothesis test. What would actually make more sense is to estimate
the mean <code>JulianDate</code> <em>for a particular year</em>. This could
be done by a regression: predict <code>JulianDate</code> from
<code>Year</code>, and then get a
“confidence interval for the mean response”
(as you would have seen in B27 or will see in C67). The
trend isn’t really linear, but is not that far off. I can modify the
previous picture to give you an idea. Putting in <code>method="lm"</code>
fits a line; as we see later, <code>lm</code> does regressions in R:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb274"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb274-1"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb274-1"></a><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(nenana, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> Year, <span class="dt">y =</span> JulianDate)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_point</span>() <span class="op">+</span></span>
<span id="cb274-2"><a href="one-sample-inference.html#cb274-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_smooth</span>(<span class="dt">method =</span> <span class="st">&quot;lm&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="04-one-sample-inference_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Compare the confidence interval for the mean <code>JulianDate</code> in
1920: 126 to 131 (the shaded area on the graph), with 2000: 121 to
125. A change of about 5 days over 80 years. And with the recent trend
that we saw above, it’s probably changing faster than that
now. Sobering indeed.</p>
