##  Drug treatment programs


 One of the goals of drug treatment programs is to lengthen
the time until the patient returns to using drugs. (It is not
generally possible to prevent patients from *ever* using drugs
again.) In one study, over 600 former drug users took part. Two
different programs, a short program and a long program, were offered
at two different sites, labelled A and B. The data can be found in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/drugusers.txt). The
variables are these:



* `ID`: patient ID number

* `age`: patient age at enrollment into the study

* `ndrugtx`: number of previous drug treatments

* `treat`: 0 for short treatment program, 1 for long program

* `site`: 0 for site A, 1 for site B

* `time`: time until return to drug use

* `censor`: whether the subject returned to drug use (1) or
not (0) during the follow-up period

* `herco`: whether subject used heroine or cocaine in the
last 3 months: 1 is both, 2 is one (either heroine or cocaine), 3 is neither.



(a) Read in the data and check in one way or another that you
have what was promised above.



(b) There are some missing values in the dataframe. Demonstrate
this using `summary`. Pipe the dataframe into
`drop_na` and show that they have gone. (`drop_na`
removes all rows that have missing values in them.)



(c) Some of these variables are recorded as numbers but are
actually categorical. Which ones? Re-define these variables in your
data frame so that they have sensible (text) values.



(d) Create a suitable reponse variable for a Cox proportional
hazards regression that predicts time until return to drug use from
the other variables.
This requires some care, because you need to be sure about what the
censoring variable actually represents and what you need it to represent.



(e) Look at the first few values of your response variable. Why
is the fifth one marked with a `+`? Explain briefly.



(f) Fit a Cox proportional hazards model, predicting from all
the other variables (except for `row` and `ID`) that you haven't used
yet. Display the results.



(g) Find which explanatory variables can be removed at $\alpha=0.05$
(there should be two of them). Bear in mind that we have categorical variables, so that looking at the output from `summary` is not enough.



(h) Remove *all* the non-significant explanatory variables
and re-fit your model. By carrying out a suitable test demonstrate
that your smaller model is the better one.



(i) <a name="part:posneg">*</a> Display your better model. Are all of the
explanatory variables significant? Do their slope coefficients have
sensible signs (plus or minus), based on what you know or can guess
about drug treatments? Explain briefly.



(j) We have three variables left in our model, `age`,
`ndrugtx` and `treat`. The quartiles of age are 27 and
37, the quartiles of `ndrugtx` are 1 and 6, and the two
possible values of `treat` are `short` and `long`. Create a data frame
with variables of these names and all possible combinations of their
values (so there should be 8 rows in the resulting data
frame). Display the resulting data frame.



(k) Obtain predicted survival probabilities for each of the
values of `age`, `ndrugtx` and `treat` used in
the previous part. You don't need to display it (we are going to
plot it shortly). 


(l) Plot your predicted survival curves. 



(m) Which of your combinations of values is predicted to take
the longest to return to drug use? Which is predicted to take the
shortest time? Explain briefly.



(n) Are your survival curve plot and your conclusions from part
(<a href="#part:posneg">here</a>) consistent, or not? Explain briefly.
