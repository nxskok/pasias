##  Cars


 My cars data file can be found at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/cars.csv). 
The values in
the data file are separated by commas; the car names are up to 29
characters long.  Display your results for each part after (a). In R,
displaying a `tibble` normally shows its first ten lines, which
is all you need here; there's no need to display all the lines.


(a) Read the data into R and list the values.




(b) Display only the car names and the countries they come from.



(c) Display everything *except* horsepower:



(d) Display only the cars that have 8-cylinder engines (but
display all the variables for those cars).



(e) Display the cylinders and horsepower for the cars that have
horsepower 70 or less.



(f) Find the mean and SD of gas mileage of the cars with 4 cylinders.
