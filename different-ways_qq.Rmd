##  Reading files different ways


 This question is about different ways of reading data files. If you're using R Studio Cloud (online), start at the beginning. If you're using R Studio running on your own computer, start at part (<a href="#part:own-start">here</a>). 



(a) Log in to R Studio Cloud. Open up a project (or start a new
one), and watch the spinning circles for a few minutes. When that's
done, create a new R Notebook with File, New File, R
Notebook. Delete the "template" notebook, but not the top four
lines with `title:` 
and `output:` in them. Add a code chunk that contains `library(tidyverse)` and run it.


(b)  <a name="part:internet-file">*</a> The easiest kind of files to read
in are ones on the Internet, with a URL address that begins with
`http` 
or `https`.  I have a small file at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/testing.txt). Click
the link to see it, and keep the tab open for the next part of this question.
This is a text file with three things on each
line, each separated by exactly one space. Read the data file into a
data frame, and display your data frame.


(c) You might have data in a file on your own computer. To read
data from such a file, you first have to *upload* it to R
Studio Cloud, and then read it from there. To practice this: open a
text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit). Go back to the web browser
tab containing the data you used in the previous part. Copy the data
from there and paste it into the text editor. Save it somewhere on
your computer (like the Desktop). Upload that file to R Studio
Cloud, read in the data and verify that you get the right
