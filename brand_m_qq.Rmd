## Brand M laundry detergent

 A survey was carried out comparing respondents' preferences of a laundry detergent M compared to a mystery brand X. For each respondent, the researchers recorded the temperature of the laundry load (low or high), whether or not they previously used brand M (yes or no), and the softness of the water used for the laundry load(hard, medium or soft). The aim of the survey was to find out what was associated with the respondents preferring brand M. The data are in <http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/brand_m.csv>.



(a) Read in and display (some of) the data. Explain briefly how the data is laid out appropriately to fit a log-linear model.



(b) Using backward elimination, build a suitable log-linear model for the associations between the variables. (Do *not* use `step`; do the elimination yourself).



(c) What is associated with the brand a  respondent prefers? By obtaining suitable frequency tables, describe the nature of these associations.
