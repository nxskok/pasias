# Reading in data

In this chapter, and from here on, the questions are first, and then my answers are in the second appearances of the problems with the same name. 
It is much better for your learning to spend some time thinking about how you would solve these problems, and after *that* you can see how I did it.

```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, child="packages.Rmd"}
```


```{r, child="oj_qq.Rmd"}
```

```{r, child="soap_qq.Rmd"}
```

```{r, child="global_qq.Rmd"}
```


My solutions follow:

```{r, child="oj.Rmd"}
```

```{r, child="soap.Rmd"}
```

```{r, child="global.Rmd"}
```
