##  Making it over the mountains


 In 1846, the Donner party (Donner and Reed
families) left Springfield, Illinois for California in covered
wagons. After reaching Fort Bridger, Wyoming, the leaders decided to
find a new route to Sacramento. They became stranded in the eastern
Sierra Nevada mountains at a place now called Donner Pass, when the
region was hit by heavy snows in late October. By the time the
survivors were rescued on April 21, 1847, 40 out of 87 had died.

After the rescue, the age and gender of each person in the party was
recorded, along with whether they survived or not. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/donner.txt). 



(a) Read in the data and display its structure. Does that agree
with the description in the previous paragraph?



(b) Make graphical or numerical summaries for each pair of
variables. That is, you should make a graph or numerical summary for
each of 
`age` vs. `gender`, `age` vs.\
`survived` and `gender` vs. `survived`. In choosing the
kind of graph or summary that you will use, bear in mind that
`survived` and `gender` are factors with two
levels. 



(c) For each of the three graphs or summaries in the previous
question, what do they tell you about the relationship between the
pair of variables concerned? Explain briefly.



(d) Fit a logistic regression predicting survival from age and
gender. Display the summary.



(e) Do both explanatory variables have an impact on survival?
Does that seem to be consistent with your numerical or graphical
summaries? Explain briefly.




(f) Are the men typically older, younger or about the same age as
the women? Considering this, explain carefully what the negative
`gendermale` slope in your logistic regression means.




(g) Obtain the median and quartiles of age, and construct a data
frame that contains all combinations of those ages and the two
genders, with columns called exactly `age` and
`gender`. Use this data frame to obtain predicted probabilities
of survival for each of those combinations of age and gender.




(h) Do your predictions support your conclusions from earlier
about the effects of age and gender? Explain briefly.
