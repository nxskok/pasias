##  Simulating power


 This question investigates power by
simulation.


(a) Use `rnorm` to generate 10 random values from a
normal distribution with mean 20 and SD 2. Do your values look
reasonable? Explain briefly. (You don't need to draw a graph.)



(b) Estimate by simulation the power of a $t$-test to reject a
null hypothesis of 20 when the true mean is also 20, the
population SD is 2, and the sample size is 10, against a (default)
two-sided alternative. Remember the
steps: (i) generate a lot of random samples from the true
distribution, (ii) run the $t$-test with the required null mean, (iii) pull out the P-values, (iv) count how many of them are 0.05
or less.



(c) In the simulation you just did, was the null hypothesis true
or false? Do you want to reject the null hypothesis or not?
Explain briefly why the simulation results you got were (or were
not) about what you would expect.



(d) By copying, pasting and editing your code from the previous
part, estimate the power of the test of $H_0: \mu=20$ (against a
two-sided alternative) when the true population mean is 22 (rather
than 20).



(e) Use R to calculate this power exactly (without
simulation). Compare the exact result with your simulation.
