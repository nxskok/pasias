##  Maximal oxygen uptake in young boys


 A physiologist wanted to understand the relationship between
physical characteristics of pre-adolescent boys and their maximal
oxygen uptake (millilitres of oxygen per kilogram of body weight). The
data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/youngboys.txt) for a
random sample of 10 pre-adolescent boys. The variables are (with
units):



* `uptake`: Oxygen uptake (millitres of oxygen per kilogram
of body weight)

* `age`: boy's age (years)

* `height`: boy's height (cm)

* `weight`: boy's weight (kg)

* `chest`: chest depth (cm).




(a) Read the data into R and confirm that you do indeed have
10 observations.



(b) Fit a regression predicting oxygen uptake from all the
other variables, and display the results.



(c) (A one-mark question.) Would you say, on the evidence so
far, that the regression fits well or badly?  Explain (very)
briefly.



(d) It seems reasonable that an older boy should have a
greater oxygen uptake, all else being equal. Is this supported
by your output?  Explain briefly.



(e) It seems reasonable that a boy with larger weight
should have larger lungs and thus a \emph{statistically
significantly} larger oxygen uptake. Is that what happens
here? Explain briefly.



(f) Fit a model that contains only the significant
explanatory variables from your first regression. How do
the R-squared values from the two regressions compare?
(The last sentence asks for more or less the same thing as
the next part. Answer it either here or there. Either
place is good.)



(g) How has R-squared changed between your two
regressions? Describe what you see in a few words.



(h) Carry out a test comparing the fit of your
two regression models. What do you conclude, and
therefore what recommendation would you make about the
regression that would be preferred?



(i) Obtain a table of correlations between all
the variables in the data frame. Do this by feeding
the whole data frame into `cor`. 
We found that a regression predicting oxygen uptake
from just `height` was acceptably good. What
does your table of correlations say about why that
is? (Hint: look for all the correlations that are
*large*.)
