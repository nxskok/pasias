##  Orange juice


 The quality of orange juice produced by a manufacturer
(identity unknown) is constantly being monitored. The manufacturer has
developed a "sweetness index" for its orange juice, for which a
higher value means sweeter juice. Is the sweetness index related to a
chemical measure such as the amount of water-soluble pectin (parts per
million) in the
orange juice? Data were obtained from 24 production runs, and the
sweetness and pectin content were measured for each run. The data are
in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ojuice.txt). Open that
link up now. You can click on that link just above to open the file.



(a) The data values are separated by a space. Use the appropriate
Tidyverse function to read the data directly from the course website
into a "tibble".




(b) Take a look at what got read in. Do you
have data for all 24 runs? 



(c) In your data frame, where did the column (variable) names
come from? How did R know where to get them from?
