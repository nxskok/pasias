##  Crimes in San Francisco -- the data


 The data in [link](http://utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/sfcrime.csv) is a huge dataset of crimes committed in San
Francisco between 2003 and 2015. The variables are:



* `Dates`: the date and time of the crime

* `Category`: the category of crime, eg. "larceny" or
"vandalism" (response).

* `Descript`: detailed description of crime.

* `DayOfWeek`: the day of the week of the crime.

* `PdDistrict`: the name of the San Francisco Police
Department district in which the crime took place.

* `Resolution`: how the crime was resolved

* `Address`: approximate street address of crime

* `X`: longitude

* `Y`: latitude


Our aim is to see whether the category of crime depends on the day of
the week and the district in which it occurred. However, there are a
lot of crime categories, so we will focus on the top four
"interesting" ones, which we will have to discover.



(a) Read in the data and verify that you have these columns and a
lot of rows. (The data may take a moment to read in. You will see why.)



(b) How is the response variable here different to the one in
the question about steak preferences (and therefore why would
`multinom` from package `nnet` be the method of choice)?



(c) Find out which crime categories there are, and 
arrange them in order of how many crimes there were in each
category. 



(d) Which are the four most frequent "interesting" crime
categories, that is to say, not including "other offenses" and
"non-criminal"? Get them into a vector called
`my.crimes`. See if you can find a way of doing this  that
doesn't involve typing them in (for full marks).



(e) (Digression, but needed for the next part.) The R vector
`letters` contains the lowercase letters from `a` to
`z`. Consider the vector `('a','m',3,'Q')`. Some of
these are found amongst the lowercase letters, and some not. Type
these into a vector `v` and explain briefly why 
`v %in% letters` produces what it does.




(f) We are going to `filter` only the rows of our data frame that
have one of the crimes in `my.crimes` as their
`Category`. Also, `select` only the columns
`Category`, `DayOfWeek` and `PdDistrict`. Save
the resulting data frame and display its structure. (You should have a
lot fewer rows than you did before.)




(g) Save these data in a file `sfcrime1.csv`.
