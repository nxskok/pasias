##  Productivity and research-and-development


 An economist compiled data on productivity improvements for
a sample of companies that produce electronic equipment. The companies
were classified according to their expenditures on research and
development in the last three years (classified as low, moderate,
high). Productivity improvement is measured on a 0--100 scale, with
most values being between 0 and 10. The economist also thought that
last year's productivity improvement would be relevant, and so
recorded this as well.

The data set can be found at

Feel free to use "R&D" as an abbreviation for 
"research and development" in your answers below.



(a) Read in and display at least some of the data.


(b) Plot productivity improvement for this year against last
year, identifying the points by the level of
research-and-development expenditure. On your plot, add regression
lines for each expenditure group.


(c) <a name="part:graph-comment">*</a> 
Look at your graph of the previous part. Do you think that (i)
knowing last year's productivity improvement tells you something
about this year's, (ii) the level of expenditure on
research-and-development has an impact on this year's productivity
improvement, (iii) there is an interaction effect between R\&D
expenditure and last year's productivity increase on this year's
productivity increase? In each case, explain briefly.


(d) Fit an analysis of covariance model without interaction. Run
the results through `drop1` with `test="F"` (the
`F` must be in quotes). What do you conclude?


(e) Now look at the `summary` of your analysis of
covariance model. Explain briefly how each of the *last three*
numbers in the `Estimate` column are consistent with your graph.


(f) Add an interaction between `last` and
`expenditure` to your analysis of covariance model. Test it
for significance using `drop1`. In the light of what you
have seen, does this surprise you? Explain briefly why you are or
are not surprised.
