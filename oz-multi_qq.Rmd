##  What sports do these athletes play?


 The data at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ais.txt) are physical
and physiological measurements of 202 male and female Australian elite
athletes. The data values are separated by *tabs*. We are going
to see whether we can predict the sport an athlete plays from their
height and weight.

The sports, if you care, are respectively basketball, 
"field athletics" (eg. shot put, javelin throw, long jump etc.),
gymnastics, netball, rowing, swimming, 400m running, tennis, sprinting
(100m or 200m running), water polo.



(a) Read in the data and display the first few rows.


(b) Make a scatterplot of height vs.\ weight, with the points
coloured by what sport the athlete plays. Put height on the $x$-axis
and weight on the $y$-axis.



(c) Explain briefly why a multinomial model (`multinom`
from `nnet`) would be the best thing to use to predict sport
played from the other variables.


(d) Fit a suitable model for predicting sport played from
height and weight. (You don't need to look at the results.) 100
steps isn't quite enough, so set `maxit` equal to a larger
number to allow the estimation to finish.


(e) Demonstrate using `anova` that `Wt` should
not be removed from this model.


(f) Make a data frame consisting of all combinations of
`Ht` 160, 180 and 200 (cm), and `Wt` 50, 75, and 100
(kg), and use it to obtain predicted probabilities of athletes of
those heights and weights playing each of the sports. Display the
results. You might have to display them smaller, or reduce the
number of decimal places
`r tufte::margin_note("For this, use *round*.")` 
to fit them on the page.


(g) For an athlete who is 180 cm tall and weighs 100 kg, what
 sport would you guess they play? How sure are you that you are
 right? Explain briefly.
