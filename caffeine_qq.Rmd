##  Can caffeine improve your performance on a test?


 
Does caffeine help students do better on a certain test? To
find out, 36 students were randomly allocated to three groups (12 in
each group).  Each student received a fixed number of cups of coffee
while they were studying, but the students didn't know whether they
were receiving all full-strength coffee ("high"), all decaf coffee
("low") or a 50-50 mixture of the two ("moderate"). For each
subject, their group was recorded as well as their score on the
test. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv), as a
`.csv` file.



(a) Read in and examine the data. How are the values laid out?



(b) Explain briefly how the data are not "tidy".



(c) Use a suitable tool from the `tidyverse` to create one
column of test scores and and one column of group labels. Call your
column of group labels `amount`. Is it a `factor`?



(d) Obtain side-by-side boxplots of test scores by amount of caffeine.



(e) Does caffeine amount seem to have an effect? If so, what
kind of effect?



(f) Run a suitable analysis of variance to determine whether
the mean test score is equal or unequal for the three groups. What
do you conclude?



(g) Why is it a good idea to run Tukey's method here?
 


(h) Run Tukey's method. What do you conclude?
