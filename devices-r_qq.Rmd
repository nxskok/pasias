##  Children and electronic devices


 Do children (aged 8--17) spend more time on electronic
devices now than they did 10 years ago? Samples of 15 children aged
8--17 were taken in each of two years, 1999 and 2009, and the children (with
their parents' help) were
asked to keep a diary of the number of hours they spent using
electronic devices on a certain day. The data are in the file
[http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/pluggedin.txt](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/pluggedin.txt).



(a) Read in the data and  verify that you have 30 rows of data from two
different years.



(b) Draw side-by-side boxplots of the number of hours for each
year. `year` is a numeric variable that we want to treat as a
factor, so we need to *make* it into a factor.




(c) Test whether the mean number of hours has *increased* since
1999. Which test did R do?




(d) Obtain a 99\% confidence interval for the difference in means.
