##  Rating beer


 Thirty-two students each rated 10 brands of beer:


* Anchor Steam

* Bass

* Beck's

* Corona

* Gordon Biersch

* Guinness

* Heineken

* Pete's Wicked Ale

* Sam Adams

* Sierra Nevada

The ratings are on a scale of 1 to 9, with a higher
rating being better.
The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/beer.txt).  I
abbreviated the beer names for the data file. I hope you can figure
out which is which.


(a) Read in the data, and look at the first few rows.
 

(b) The researcher who collected the data wants to see which
beers are rated similarly to which other beers. Try to create a
distance matrix from these data and explain why it didn't do what
you wanted. (Remember to get rid of the `student` column
first.) 
 

(c) The R function `t()` *transposes* a matrix: that
is, it interchanges rows and columns. Feed the transpose of your
read-in beer ratings into `dist`. Does this now give
distances between beers?
 

(d) Try to explain briefly why I used `as.dist` in the
class example (the languages one) but `dist` here. (Think
about the form of the input to each function.)
 

(e) <a name="part:beer-dendro">*</a> Obtain a clustering of the beers, using Ward's method. Show
the dendrogram.
 

(f) What seems to be a sensible number of clusters? Which
beers are in which cluster?
 

(g) Re-draw your dendrogram with your clusters indicated.
 

(h) Obtain a K-means
clustering with 2 clusters.^[If you haven't gotten to K-means clustering yet, leave this and save it for later.]
Note that you will need to use the (transposed) 
*original  data*, not the distances. Use a suitably large value of
`nstart`. (The data are ratings all on the same scale, so
there is no need for `scale` here. In case you were
wondering.) 
 

(i) How many beers are in each cluster?
 

(j) *Which* beers are in each cluster? You can do this
simply by obtaining the cluster memberships and using
`sort` as in the last question, or you can do it as I did
in class by obtaining the 
names of the things to be clustered and picking out the ones of
them that are in cluster 1, 2, 3, \ldots .)
