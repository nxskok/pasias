##  Inferring ice break-up in Nenana


 Nenana, Alaska, is about 50 miles west of Fairbanks.
Every spring, there is a contest in Nenana. A wooden tripod is
placed on the frozen river, and people try to guess the exact minute
when the ice melts enough for the tripod to fall through the ice. The
contest started in 1917 as an amusement for railway workers, and has
taken place every year since. Now, hundreds of thousands of people
enter their guesses on the Internet and the prize for the winner can
be as much as \$300,000. 

Because so much money is at stake, and because the exact same tripod
is placed at the exact same spot on the ice every year, the data are
consistent and accurate. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/nenana.txt). 

Yes, we saw these data before.



(a) Read the data into R, as before, or use the data frame that
you read in before.  Note that the values are separated by
*tabs* rather than spaces, so you'll need an appropriate
`read_` to read it in.



(b) Obtain a 90\% confidence interval for the mean
`JulianDate`. What interval do you get? Looking back at your
histogram, do you have any doubts about the validity of what you
have just done?



(c) An old-timer in Nenana strokes his grey beard and says
"When I were young, I remember the tripod used to fall into the water around May 10". 
In a non-leap year, May 10 is Julian day 130. Test the null hypothesis that the 
mean `JulianDay` is 130, against the alternative that it is less.  What do you conclude?
What practical implication does that have 
(assuming that the old-timer has a good memory)?



(d) Plot `JulianDate` against `Year` on a
scatterplot. What recent trends, if any, do you see? Comment
briefly. (You did this before, but I have some extra comments on
the graph this time, so feel free to just read this part.)
