##  Repeated measures with no background


 Nine people are randomly chosen to receive one of three
treatments, labelled A, B and C. Each person has their response
`y` to the treatment measured at three times, labelled T1, T2
and T3. The main aim of the study is to properly assess the effects of
the treatments. A higher value of `y` is better.

The data are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/rm.txt).



(a) There are $9 \times 3=27$ observations  of `y` in
this study. Why would it be wrong to treat these as 27 independent
observations? Explain briefly.

Solution


There are only 9 people with 3 observations on each person. The
three observations on the same person are likely to be correlated
with each other, and so treating them as independent would be a
mistake.
This is repeated-measures data. If you say that, that's useful,
but you also need to demonstrate that you know what repeated
measures *means* and why it needs to be handled differently
from one-observation-per-individual data. Another way to look at
it is that individuals will differ from each other, and so there
ought to be an "individual" effect included in the model, in the
same way that you would include a block effect in a randomized
block design: not because you care about differences among
individuals, but because you are pretty sure they'll be there and
you want to account for them.

$\blacksquare$

(b) Read in the data values. Are they tidy or untidy?  Explain
briefly. (The data values are separated by *tabs*, like the
Australian athlete data.)

Solution


We therefore need `read_tsv`. I'm not quite sure what to
call this one:
```{r rm-1 }
my_url <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/rm.txt"
treatments <- read_tsv(my_url)
treatments
```

     
Find a way to display what you have, so you can decide whether it is
tidy or not.
Each observation of `y` is in a row by itself, so this is
tidy, or long format. You might even call this extra-tidy, because
each person is spread over three rows, one for each time point.
Looking ahead, this is ideal for making a graph, or for doing the
advanced version of the analysis with `lme4`, but it is not
so good for our MANOVA way of doing a repeated measures
analysis. That we will have to prepare for.

$\blacksquare$

(c) Make a spaghetti plot: that is, a plot of `y`
against time, with the observations for the same individual joined
by lines which are coloured according to the treatment that
individual received.

Solution


The individuals are labelled in `subject` and the
treatments are in `trt`, which means we need to do this:
```{r bock}
ggplot(treatments, aes(x = time, y = y, colour = trt, group = subject)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

     

I'm going to be all smug and tell you that I got this right first
time. (I'm telling you this because it doesn't happen often.) If it didn't come out that way for you, no stress: figure out what went wrong, fix it, and no one is any the wiser. On a spaghetti plot, you want to join together the points that belong to the same *subject*, and you want to colour them by *treatment*, so `colour` needs to be `trt` and `group` needs to be `subject`, since otherwise *all* the observations on the same treatment will get connected by lines, which is not what you want. You can use `group` in other contexts too, but for us we would normally distinguish groups by colour, and here we have two grouping variables (subject and treatment), which we want to distinguish in different ways.

$\blacksquare$

(d) On your spaghetti plot, how do the values of `y` for
the treatments compare over time?

Solution


The most obvious thing is that the values of `y` *all*
go up over time, regardless of which treatment they were from.
At the initial time T1, the treatments are all about the same, but
at the second and third time points, `y` is bigger for
treatment C than for the other two treatments (which are about the
same as each other). If you like, say that the gap between
treatment C and the others is increasing over time, or that the
lines for treatment C are steeper than for the other
treatments. Any of those ways of saying it comes to the same
conclusion. 
Extra: if you look at the lines of the same colour (treatment),
they don't seem to cross over very much. That suggests that an
individual who starts with a larger value of `y`
(relatively, compared to the other individuals on the same
treatment) tends to stay larger than the other individuals on the
same treatment all the way through. This would be another thing
you'd see if the measurements for the individuals are correlated,
or if there is an "individual effect" to go along with a
treatment effect (and a time effect).
If you think of this like an individual-level version of an
interaction plot (which would be obtained by plotting the
*means* for each treatment at each time), there is a
suggestion here of an interaction between treatment and time, as
well as a treatment effect (the latter because treatment C appears
better than the rest). 

$\blacksquare$

(e) Explain briefly how the data are in the wrong format for a
repeated-measures ANOVA (done using MANOVA, as in class), and use
`pivot_wider` to get the data set into the right format.

Solution


For MANOVA, we want the three responses (here, the values of
`y` at the three different times) in three separate
columns, with *all* the measurements for one subject in one
row (rather than on three separate rows, as here).
`pivot_wider` is the flip-side of `pivot_longer`: instead of
making different columns that all measure the same thing into one
column, we split one column that contains things that are (slightly)
different from each other (here, `y` at different
times). It needs two inputs: `names_from`, the current single column that
contains the column names you are going to make, and `values_from`, the values to
carry along with them:

```{r rm-2 }
treatments %>% pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = y) -> tr2
tr2
```

  

(I got this right the first time too. I must be having a good day!)

Technical detail: in `pivot_longer`, the column names are in quotes because they don't exist yet, but in `pivot_wider`, they are *not* in quotes because they are columns that already exist.

Note that the `time` and `y` columns have
*disappeared*: the columns labelled with the time points are
where those values of `y` have gone. The nine subjects make up
the nine rows of the new "wide" data set, which is in the format we
want.

$\blacksquare$

(f) Run a repeated-measures ANOVA the `Manova` way. What do you
conclude from it?

Solution


Create the response variable first, and use it in an `lm`:
```{r rm-3 }
response <- with(tr2, cbind(T1, T2, T3))
treatment.1 <- lm(response ~ trt, data = tr2)
```

     

Now we have to construct the within-subject stuff, for which we need
to get the different times we have. You can type them in again (fine
here), or get them from the `response` you just made:

```{r rm-4 }
times <- colnames(response)
times.df <- data.frame(times=factor(times))
```

 

This is where the possible time effect is accounted for. Because time
is within-subjects (each subject is measured at several different
times) but treatment is between subjects (each subject only gets one
treatment), the two things have to be treated separately, in this
approach at least. 

Then, uppercase-M `Manova`:

```{r rm-5 }
treatment.2 <- Manova(treatment.1, idata = times.df, idesign = ~times)
summary(treatment.2)
```

(Since I call things by the same names every time, my code for one of
these looks a lot like my code for any of the others.)

Start near the bottom with the Mauchly tests for sphericity. These are *just* significant, so that instead of looking at the univariate tests, look at the bottom for the Huynh-Feldt adjusted P-values, the one for the interaction being 0.0061. This is a bit bigger than the one for the interaction in the univariate tests (0.0010), the latter being deceptively small because sphericity is actually no good.

Compare this, if you like, with the multivariate tests for the interaction. In this case, these are actually not all the same; the largest P-value is the Pillai one, which at 0.0062 is very close to the properly adjusted univariate test.

Finally, interpretation. We look *only* at the interaction. This
is significant, so the effect of treatment is different at the
different times. And we **stop there**.


$\blacksquare$

(g) How is your conclusion from the previous part consistent
with your spaghetti plot? Explain briefly.

Solution


The thing that the interaction means is that the effect of
treatment is different over different times. That shows up in the
spaghetti plot by treatment C being the same as the others at the
beginning, but clearly better than the others at the later
times. That is to say, you can't talk about "an" effect of
treatment, because whether or not treatment C is better than the
others depends on which time you're looking at.

Extra: we used the MANOVA way of doing the repeated-measures
analysis. There is another way, "mixed models", which is in some
ways less familiar and in some ways more. 

In any analysis of variance, there are two kinds of effects of
things you may care about: fixed effects and random effects. Fixed
effects are things like the treatment and time here, where the
ones you look at are the only ones you are interested in (in this
study at least). If you had wanted to assess another treatment,
you would have designed it into the study; if you cared about
other times, you would have measured `y` at those times
too. The subjects, though, are different: they are a random sample
of all possible people, and you want your results to generalize to
the population of all people of whom your subjects are a
sample.^[In practice, things are usually fuzzier than this,      because the subjects in your study are typically the ones you      could get, rather than being a physical random sample of all      possible people, but we usually act as if our subjects are a      random sample of all possible subjects.]
So subjects are a different kind of thing and they have what are
called random effects. When each subject only gives one
measurement, as in all the things we've seen so
far,^[Including matched pairs, because what we do there is      to take the difference between the two measurements for each      person and throw away the actual measurements themselves, so      that each subject still only gives us one measurement.] it
doesn't matter how you treat (statistically) the subjects, but
when each subject gives *more* than one measurement, it does
matter. Which is why we have to do the `idesign` stuff in
the MANOVA, or what you will see below.

A model with both fixed and random effects is called a mixed model.

We're going to make the assumption that the effect of being one
subject rather than another is to move the value of `y` up
or down by a fixed amount regardless of treatment or time, on
average (each subject is different, but *within* a subject
the random effect is the same size). That seems reasonable, given
the spaghetti plot, where some subjects seemed to give
consistently larger or smaller values of `y` than
others. This is a so-called "random-intercepts" model. In the
package `lme4`, there is a function `lmer` that
looks like `lm`, except for the way in which you specify
the random effects. It looks like this, noting that 
*it works with the tidy data frame* that we read in from the file and made
the spaghetti plot out of:
```{r rm-8 }
treatment.4 <- lmer(y ~ trt * time + (1 | subject), data = treatments)
drop1(treatment.4, test = "Chisq")
```

     

The way to read that model is "`y` depends on the combination of treatment and time and also on a random intercept for each subject". 
This is the way in which the model captures the idea that
each subject is different. 

You don't get a test for the random effects; you are *assuming* that the
subjects will be different from each other and you want to *adjust* for
that, rather than testing for it.^[This is rather like the test for blocks in a randomized  block design: you want to *allow* for differences among blocks,  but you don't especially care to test that there *are* any. In  fact, blocks are a lot like subjects, in that they are typically  things like different experimental plots in which plants are grown,  or different days on which the experiment is conducted, and you want to generalize from the blocks you observed, which are certainly *not* all possible blocks, to the population of all possible blocks.]
All you get is tests for the fixed effects that are currently up for
grabs, in this case the interaction, which is strongly significant.
