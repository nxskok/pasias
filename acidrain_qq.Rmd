##  Acid rain


 One of the first noticeable effects of climate change was
"acid rain". This is formed by the water vapour in clouds combining
with nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, which come from coal and oil
production. How does the acidity of rain affect the acidity of the
soil on which it falls? (This will have an effect on the kind of
plants that can be grown in that soil.) Acidity is measured using the
pH scale, where a pH of 7 is chemically neutral, a number less than 7
is acidic, and a number greater than 7 is alkaline.

An experiment was conducted at the Florida Institute of Food and
Agricultural Sciences, to determine how acidity of rain affects soil
acidity. Experimental plots were irrigated with rainwater that was
prepared to have one of two different pH levels, 3.7 and 4.5. The
acidity of the soil was then measured at three different depths,
0--15, 15--30, and 30--46 centimetres. This was done on three
different dates, in April and June 1991. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/acidrain.csv).



(a) Read in and display the data.


(b) Draw a grouped boxplot to show how soil acidity depends on
the pH of the rain and the soil depth. (The first time you do this
you might not get the boxplot you want. How can you fix that?)


(c) What does your grouped boxplot say about likely
interactions? Explain briefly.


(d) Fit an ANOVA with interaction. What do you conclude from
it? You may want to create a column that is the factor version of
`rain_pH` first.
