##  Growth of Mizuna lettuce seeds


 In 2010, a group of students planted some Mizuna lettuce
seeds, and recorded how they grew. The data were saved in an Excel
spreadsheet, which is at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/mizuna.xlsx). The columns
are: the date, the height (in cm) of (I presume) the tallest plant,
the amount of water added since the previous date (ml), the
temperature in the container where the seedlings were growing, and any
additional notes that the students made (edited for length by me). The
top line of the data file is variable names.



(a) Read the
spreadsheet data.



(b) Make a plot of `height` against your
dates, with the points joined by lines.



(c) Label each point on the plot with the
amount of water added up to that point.
