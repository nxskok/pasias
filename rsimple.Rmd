  
## The very basics in R

 Do this question in R. It is just like the one on
Assignment 0.


(a) Read the data $1,2,3,4,5,7$ into a variable in R. Verify
that your variable contains the correct values. (Hint:
`c()`.)


Solution


Call the variable whatever you like. I used `w`.
```{r rsimple-1 }
w <- c(1,2,3,4,5,7)
w  
``` 

Top two lines in a Script window, echoed in the Console; bottom line
in the Console.
      
$\blacksquare$

(b) Find the mean and the standard deviation of your variable.


Solution


Ask for them, one by one:
```{r rsimple-2 }
mean(w)  
``` 
and
```{r rsimple-3 }
sd(w)  
``` 

$\blacksquare$
