##  Understanding a MANOVA


 One use of discriminant analysis is to
understand the results of a MANOVA. This question is a followup to a
previous MANOVA that we did, the one with two variables `y1`
and `y2` and three groups `a` through `c`. The
data were in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/simple-manova.txt).



(a) Read the data in again and run the MANOVA that you did
before. 



(b) Run a discriminant analysis "predicting" group from the
two response variables. Display the output.



(c) <a name="part:output">*</a> In the output from the discriminant analysis,
why are there exactly two linear discriminants `LD1` and
`LD2`?




(d) <a name="part:svd">*</a> From the output, how would you say that the
first linear discriminant `LD1` compares in importance to the
second one `LD2`: much more important, more important, equally
important, less important, much less important? Explain briefly. 




(e) Obtain a plot of the
discriminant scores.




(f) Describe briefly how `LD1` and/or `LD2`
separate the groups. Does your picture confirm the relative importance
of `LD1` and `LD2` that you found  back in part (<a href="#part:svd">here</a>)? Explain briefly.




(g) What makes group `a` have a low score on `LD1`?
There are two steps that you need to make: consider the means of group
`a` on variables `y1` and `y2` and how they
compare to the other groups, and consider how
`y1` and `y2` play into the score on `LD1`.




(h) Obtain predictions for the group memberships of each
observation, and make a table of the actual group memberships against
the predicted ones. How many of the observations were wrongly classified?
