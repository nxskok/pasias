##  Tidying the Jays data


 This question is about the Blue Jays data set (that I used
in class).



(a) The Blue Jays baseball data set is at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jays15-home.csv). Read
it into R. Check that you have 25 rows and a bunch of variables.




(b) Pick out only the games that were against the New York Yankees
(the variable `opp` is equal to `NYY`). Investigate all
the columns.  What do you notice about these games?





(c) From the whole data frame, pick out only the games where the
attendance was more than 30,000, showing only the columns
`attendance` and `Daynight`. How many of them are there
(just count them)? How many are day games and how many night games
(just count those too)?




(d) Display the mean and standard deviation of attendances at all
day and night games.




(e) Make normal quantile plots of the day attendances and the night
attendances, separately. Do you see any evidence of non-normality?
(You would expect to on the night attendances because of the big
opening-night value.)
