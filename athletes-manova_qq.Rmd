##  How do height and weight depend on sport played by elite athletes?


 This question uses the data on Australian elite athletes,
which can be found at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ais.txt). 202 elite
athletes had various physical and physiological measurements taken,
and for each athlete, their gender (in the column `Sex`) and
the sport they play (`Sport`) was also noted. The data values
are separated by *tabs*, meaning that `read_tsv` will
read them in.



(a) Read in the data and verify that you have 202 rows and 13
columns. 


(b) We are going to see whether the height-weight combination
of an athlete depends significantly on which sport they play and which gender
they are. Explain (very) briefly why a multivariate analysis of
variance will be necessary to do this.


(c) Create a response variable for a MANOVA. (You don't need to
show what you got, since it is rather big.) The columns you want are
called `Ht` and `Wt`.


(d) Run a multivariate analysis of variance to see whether the
height-weight combination depends significantly on gender, sport or the
combination of both. Display the results. Use the small-m
`manova` way to do this one.


(e) Briefly justify removing the interaction term from your
previous model, and fit a model without it. You can use either
`manova` or `Manova` for this; they should both
work. (You only need to use one of them.)  Display your results.



(f) See if you can make a graph that shows what's going on
here. Bear in mind that you have two quantitative variables and
*two* categorical ones, so you will need to find a way to
display everything. Hint: what would you do with two quantitative
variables and *one* categorical one? Can you find a way to
generalize that idea by displaying the other categorical variable
differently? I think we have seen a couple of ideas that will work,
somewhere in the lecture notes (but in a different context). Or you
can search for ideas, of course.
For full marks, obtain a plot which does not give you any
warnings. (The grader will know which of the possible plots give
warnings, and will deduct extra marks if you assert that a plot
gives no warnings when in fact it does. That is to say, if you get
any warnings, *you need to include those in what you hand in*).
