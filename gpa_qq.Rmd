##  Predicting GPA of computer science students


 The file
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/gpa.txt) contains some
measurements of academic achievement for a number of university
students studying computer science:



* High school grade point average

* Math SAT score

* Verbal SAT score

* Computer Science grade point average

* Overall university grade point average.




(a) Read in the data and display it (or at least the first ten lines).



(b) <a name="part:hsu-scatter">*</a> Make a scatterplot of high school GPA against university
GPA. Which variable should be the response and which
explanatory? Explain briefly. Add a smooth trend to your plot.



(c) Describe any relationship on your scatterplot: its direction, its
strength and its shape. Justify your description briefly.



(d) <a name="part:highonly">*</a> Fit a linear regression for predicting university GPA
from high-school GPA and display the results.



(e) Two students have been admitted to university. One has
a high school GPA of 3.0 and the other a high school GPA of   
3.5. Obtain suitable intervals that summarize the GPAs that each of these
two students might obtain in university.



(f) <a name="part:all">*</a> Now obtain a regression predicting university GPA from
high-school GPA as well as the two SAT scores. Display your results.



(g) Test whether adding the two SAT scores has improved the
prediction of university GPA. What do you conclude?




(h) Carry out a backward elimination starting out from your
model in part (<a href="#part:all">here</a>). Which model do you end up with?
Is it the same model as you fit in (<a href="#part:highonly">here</a>)?



(i) These students were studying computer science at
university. Do you find your backward-elimination result
sensible or surprising, given this? Explain briefly.
