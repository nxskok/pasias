##  Similarity of species 


 Two scientists assessed the dissimilarity
between a number 
of species by recording the number of positions in the protein
molecule cytochrome-$c$ where the two species being compared have
different amino acids. The dissimilarities that they recorded are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/species.txt).



(a) Read the data into a data frame and take a look at it.



(b) Bearing in mind that the values you read in are
*already* dissimilarities, convert them into a `dist`
object suitable for running a cluster analysis on, and display the
results. (Note that you need to get rid of any columns that don't
contain numbers.)



(c) Run a cluster analysis using single-linkage and obtain a dendrogram.



(d) Run a cluster analysis using Ward's method and obtain a dendrogram.



(e) Describe how the two dendrograms from the last two parts
look different.



(f) Looking at your clustering for Ward's method, what seems to
be a sensible number of clusters? Draw boxes around those clusters.



(g) List which cluster each species is in, for your preferred
number of clusters (from Ward's method).
