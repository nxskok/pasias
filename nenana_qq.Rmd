##  Nenana, Alaska


 Nenana, Alaska, is about 50 miles west of Fairbanks.
Every spring, there is a contest in Nenana. A wooden tripod is
placed on the frozen river, and people try to guess the exact minute
when the ice melts enough for the tripod to fall through the ice. The
contest started in 1917 as an amusement for railway workers, and has
taken place every year since. Now, hundreds of thousands of people
enter their guesses on the Internet and the prize for the winner can
be as much as \$300,000.

Because so much money is at stake, and because the exact same tripod
is placed at the exact same spot on the ice every year, the data are
consistent and accurate. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/nenana.txt). 



(a) Read the data into R.  Note that the values are
separated by *tabs* rather than spaces, so you'll need an
appropriate `read_` to read it in.



(b) Find a way of displaying how many rows and columns your
data frame has, and some of the values. Describe the first and last
of the variables that
you appear to have.



(c) Dates and times are awkward to handle with software. (We
see more ways later in the course.)  The column `JulianDate`
expresses the time that the tripod fell through the ice as a
fractional number of days since December 31. This enables the time
(as a fraction of the way through the day) to be recorded as well,
the whole thing being an ordinary number.
Make a histogram of the Julian dates. Comment briefly on its shape.



(d) Plot `JulianDate` against `Year` on a
scatterplot. What recent trends, if any, do you see? Comment briefly.
