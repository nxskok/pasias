##  The Worcester survey


 The Worcester survey was a long-term study of
all myocardial-infarction^[Heart attack.] victims admitted to hospitals in the
Worcester, Massachusetts area.^[Worcester is pronounced, by locals, *Woo-stuh*.] 
The data have been well studied, and can be found in
the file [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/whas100.csv).



(a) Read the data and
 display the first few rows of the data frame. You might get an extra
 column, which you can ignore.
For your information, the variables are:


* patient ID code

* admission date

* date of last followup (this is the date of death if the
patient died)

* length of hospital stay (days)

* followup time (days) (time between admission and last followup)

* followup status: 1=dead, 0=alive

* Age in years (at admission)

* gender (0=male, 1=female)

* body mass index (kg/m$^2$)

 

(b) Create a suitable response variable for a Cox proportional
hazards model for time of survival, using the followup time and
followup status.
 

(c) Fit a Cox proportional hazards model predicting survival time
from age, gender and BMI. Obtain the `summary` (but you don't
need to comment on it yet).

 

(d) Test the overall fit of the model. What does the result mean?
 

(e) Can any of your explanatory variables be removed from the
model? Explain briefly.
 

(f) Remove your most non-significant explanatory variable from
the model and fit again. Take a look at the results. Are all your
remaining explanatory variables significant? (If all your
explanatory variables were previously significant, you can skip this part.)
 

(g) Calculate the 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartiles of
age and BMI. (`quantile`.) Round these off to the
nearest whole number. (Do the rounding off yourself, though R has a
function `round` that does this, which you can investigate if
you want.) As an alternative, you can get these by passing the whole
data frame, or the columns of it you want, into `summary`.
 

(h) Make a data frame out of all the combinations of
age and BMI values (that you obtained in the previous part) suitable for predicting
with. 
 

(i) Obtain predicted survival probabilities for each of the values
in your new data frame. Use your best model. (You don't need to look
at the results, though you can if you want to.)
 

(j) Make a graph depicting the survival curves from
`survfit` with different colours distinguishing the different
survival curves.
 

(k) What is the effect of age on survival? What is the effect
of BMI on survival? Explain briefly. (You will have to disentangle
the meaning of the different coloured lines on the plot to do this.)
