##  Understanding athletes' height, weight, sport and gender


 On a previous assignment, we used MANOVA on the athletes
data to demonstrate that there was a significant relationship between
the combination of the athletes' height and weight, with the sport they
play and the athlete's gender. The problem with MANOVA is that it
doesn't give any information about the *kind* of relationship. To
understand that, we need to do discriminant analysis, which is the
purpose of this question.

The data can be found at
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/ais.txt). 



(a) Once again, read in and display (some of) the data, bearing
in mind that the data values are separated by *tabs*. (This
ought to be a free two marks.)


(b) Use `unite` to make a new column in your data frame
which contains the sport-gender *combination*. Display it. (You
might like to display only a few columns so that it is clear that
you did the right thing.) Hint: you've seen `unite` in the
peanuts example in class.


(c) Run a discriminant analysis "predicting" sport-gender
combo from height and weight. Display the results. (No comment
needed yet.)


(d) What kind of height and weight would make an athlete have a
large (positive) score on `LD1`? Explain briefly.


(e) Make a guess at the sport-gender combination that has the
*highest* score on LD1. Why did you choose the combination you did?


(f) <a name="part:ld2">*</a> What combination of height and weight would make an athlete have a
*small* (that is, very negative) score on LD2? Explain briefly.


(g) Obtain predictions for the discriminant analysis, and use
these to make a plot of `LD1` score against `LD2`
score, with the individual athletes distinguished by what sport they play
and gender they are. (You can use colour to distinguish them, or you
can use shapes. If you want to go the latter way, there are clues in
my solutions to the MANOVA question about these athletes.)


(h) Look on your graph for the four athletes with the smallest
(most negative) scores on `LD2`. What do they have in common?
Does this make sense, given your answer to part (<a href="#part:ld2">here</a>)?
Explain briefly.


(i) Obtain a (very large) square table, or a (very long) table
with frequencies, of actual and predicted sport-gender
combinations. You will probably have to make the square table very
small to fit it on the page. For that, displaying the columns in two
or more sets is OK (for example, six columns and all the rows, six
more columns and all the rows, then the last five columns for all
the rows).  Are there any sport-gender combinations that
seem relatively easy to classify correctly?  Explain briefly.
