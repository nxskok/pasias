##  Do characteristics of urine depend on obesity?


 A study was made of the characteristics of urine of young
men. The men were classified into four groups based on their degree of
obesity. (The groups are labelled `a, b, c, d`.) Four variables
were measured, `x` (which you can ignore), pigment creatinine,
chloride and chlorine. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/urine.csv) as a
`.csv` file. There are 45 men altogether.



(a) Read in the data and check that you have the right number
of observations and the right variables.
 

(b) Make boxplots of each of the three variables of interest
against obesity group. 
 

(c) How, if at all, do the groups differ on the variables of interest?
 

(d) Run a multivariate analysis of variance, using the three
variables of interest as response variables, and the obesity group
as explanatory. (This is a so-called one-way MANOVA.)
 

(e) What do you conclude? Is this in line with what your
boxplots said? Explain briefly.
