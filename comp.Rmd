$\blacksquare$

notes:

- pick a chapter

- add the black square to the end of every solution in that chapter (by searching for the next solution and skipping back over its question)

- go to justq.Rmd. Run the code down to the last chunk. Put the chapter title in the last chunk and run that too.

- check that those files now exist.

- make a copy of the child docs in the chapter file and paste it before. Add a `_qq` to each file name. Add "my solutions:" in between.

- rebuild the book
