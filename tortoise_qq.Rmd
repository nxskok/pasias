##  Tortoise shells and eggs


 A biologist measured the length of the carapace (shell) of
female tortoises, and then x-rayed the tortoises to count how many
eggs they were carrying. The length is measured in millimetres. The
data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/tortoise-eggs.txt). The
biologist is wondering what kind of relationship, if any, there is
between the carapace length (as an explanatory variable) and the
number of eggs (as a response variable).



(a) Read in the data, and check that your values look
reasonable. 
 

(b) Obtain a scatterplot, with a smooth trend, of the data.

 

(c) The biologist expected that a larger tortoise would be able
to carry more eggs. Is that what the scatterplot is suggesting?
Explain briefly why or why not.

 

(d) Fit a straight-line relationship and display the summary.

 

(e) Add a squared term to your regression, fit that and display
the  summary.

 

(f) Is a curve better than a line for these data? Justify your
answer in two ways: by comparing a measure of fit, and  by doing a
suitable test of significance.

 

(g) Make a residual plot for the straight line model: that is, plot
the residuals against the fitted values.
 Does this echo
your conclusions of the previous part? In what way? Explain briefly.
