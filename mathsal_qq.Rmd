##  Salaries of mathematicians


 A researcher in a scientific
foundation wanted to evaluate the relationship between annual salaries
of mathematicians and three explanatory variables:


* an index of work quality

* number of years of experience

* an index of publication success.


The data can be found at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/mathsal.txt). Data from
only a relatively small number of mathematicians were available.



(a) Read in the data and check that you have a sensible number
of rows and the right number of columns. (What does "a sensible  number of rows" mean here?)


(b) Make scatterplots of `salary` against each of the three explanatory variables. If you can, do this with *one* `ggplot`.


(c) Comment briefly on the direction and strength of each
relationship with `salary`.


(d) <a name="regone">*</a> Fit a regression predicting salary from the other three
variables, and obtain a `summary` of the results.


(e) How can we justify the statement 
"one or more of the explanatory variables helps to predict salary"? How is this
consistent with the value of R-squared?


(f) Would you consider removing any of the variables from this
regression? Why, or why not?


(g) Do you think it would be a mistake to take *both* of
`workqual` and `pubsucc` out of the regression? Do a
suitable test. Was your guess right?


(h) Back in part (<a href="#regone">here</a>), you fitted a regression with all
three explanatory variables. By making suitable plots, assess
whether there is any evidence that (i) that the linear model should
be a curve, (ii) that the residuals are not normally 
distributed, (iii) that there is "fan-out", where the residuals are getting
bigger *in size* as the fitted values get bigger? Explain
briefly how you came to your conclusions in each case.
