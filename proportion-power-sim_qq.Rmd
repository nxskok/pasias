##  Simulating power for proportions


 In opinion surveys (and other places), we are testing for a
proportion $p$ (for example, the proportion of people agreeing with
some statement). Often, we want to know whether the proportion is
"really" greater than 0.5.^[That would mean assessing whether  an observed proportion could be greater than 0.5 just by chance, or  whether it is bigger enough than 0.5 to reject chance as a  plausible explanation.]  
That would entail testing a null
$H_0: p=0.5$ against an alternative $H_a: p>0.5$. This is usually done
by calculating the test statistic
$$ z = { \hat{p} - 0.5 \over \sqrt{0.25/n}},$$
where $\hat{p}$ is the observed proportion in the sample,
and getting a P-value from the upper tail of a standard normal
distribution. (The 0.25 is $p(1-p)$ where $p=0.5$.) This is what
`prop.test` does, as we investigate shortly.



(a) Use `rbinom` to generate a random value from a
binomial distribution with $n=100$ and $p=0.6$. There are three
inputs to `rbinom`: the first one should be the number 1, and
the second and third are the $n$ and $p$ of the binomial distribution.



(b) Using the random binomial that you generated just above, use
`prop.test` to test whether it could reasonably have come
from a binomial population with $n=100$ and $p=0.5$, or whether $p$
is actually bigger than 0.5. (Of course,
you know it actually did not come from a population with $p=0.5$.)
`prop.test` has, for us, four inputs, thus:


* the observed number of successes

* the `n` of the binomial distribution

* the null-hypothesis `p` of the binomial distribution

* the alternative hypothesis, here "greater"




(c) Run `prop.test` again, just as you did before, but this
time save the result, and extract the piece of it called
`p.value`. Is that the P-value from your test?



(d) Estimate the power of a test of
$H_0: p=0.5$ against $H_a: p>0.5$ when $n=500$ and $p=0.56$, using
$\alpha=0.05$. There are three steps:


* generate random samples from binomial
distributions with $n=500$ and $p=0.56$, repeated "many" times
(something like 1000 or 10,000 is good)

* run `prop.test` on each of those
random samples 

* extract the P-value for each test and
save the results (in a column called, perhaps, `pvals`).

So I lied: the fourth and final step is to count how many of
those P-values are 0.05 or less.
