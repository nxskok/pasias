##  Feeling the heat


 In summer, the city of Toronto issues Heat Alerts for 
"high heat or humidity that is expected to last two or more days". The
precise definitions are shown at
[link](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=923b5ce6dfb31410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD). During
a heat alert, the city opens Cooling Centres and may extend the hours
of operation of city swimming pools, among other things. All the heat
alert days from 2001 to 2016 are listed at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/heat.csv).

The word "warning" is sometimes used in place of "alert" in these
data. They mean the same thing.^[Unlike *thunderstorm watch*  and *thunderstorm warning*, which mean different things.]



(a) Read the data into R, and display the data frame. Note that there are four columns:


* a numerical `id` (numbered upwards from the first Heat
Alert in 2001; some of the numbers are missing)

* the `date` of the heat alert, in year-month-day
format with 4-digit years.

* a text `code` for the type of heat alert

* `text` describing the kind of heat alert. This can be quite long. 




(b) In your data frame, are the dates stored as genuine dates or as text? How can you tell?



(c) Which different heat alert codes do you have, and how many of each?



(d) Use the `text` in your dataset (or look back
at the original data file) to describe briefly in your own
words what the various codes represent.



(e) How many (regular and extended) heat alert events
are there altogether? A heat alert event is a stretch of
consecutive days, on all of which there is a heat alert or
extended heat alert. Hints: (i) you can answer this from
output you already have; (ii) how can you tell when a heat
alert event *starts*?



(f) We are going to investigate how many heat alert
days
there were in each year. To do that, we have
to extract the year from each of our dates. 



(g) Count the number of heat alert days for each
year, by tabulating the year variable.
Looking at this table, would you say that there
have been more heat alert days in recent years? Explain
(very) briefly.
