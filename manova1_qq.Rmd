##  Fabricated data


 The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/simple-manova.txt)
(probably made up) are measurements of two 
variables `y1` and `y2` on three groups, labelled
`a`, `b` and `c`. We want to see whether
`y1` or `y2` or some combination of them differ among
the groups.



(a) Read in the data and check that you have 12 observations on
2 numeric variables from 3 different groups.



(b) Run a one-way ANOVA predicting `y1` from
`group`. Are there any significant differences in `y1`
among the groups? If necessary, run Tukey. What do you conclude?



(c) Repeat all the previous part for `y2`.



(d) Make a plot of `y1` against `y2`, with the
points distinguished by which group they are from.



(e) How is it that group `b` is not distinguishable on
either `y1` or `y2` individually (from the ANOVAs),
but *is* distinguishable on your graph? Explain briefly.



(f) Run a one-way multivariate analysis of variance, obtaining
a P-value. Note the very small P-value.
