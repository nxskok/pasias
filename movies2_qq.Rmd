##  Movie ratings again


 This question again uses the movie rating data at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/movie-lengths.csv).



(a) Read the data into R and obtain the number of movies of
each rating and the *median* length of movies of each rating.



(b) Obtain a suitable graph that assesses the assumptions for
ANOVA. Why do you think it is not reasonable to run ANOVA here? Explain
briefly. 



(c) Run a Mood's median test (use `smmr` if you
like). What do you conclude, in the context of the data?
