##  Dissimilarities between fruits


 Consider the fruits apple, orange, banana, pear,
strawberry, blueberry. We are going to work with these four
properties of fruits:


* has a round shape

* Is sweet

* Is crunchy

* Is a berry



(a)  Make a table with fruits as columns, and with
rows "round shape", "sweet", "crunchy", "berry". In each cell
of the table, put a 1 if the fruit has the property named in the
row, and a 0 if it does not. (This is your opinion, and may not
agree with mine. That doesn't matter, as long as you follow through
with whatever your choices were.)
 


(b) We'll define the dissimilarity between two fruits to be the
number of qualities they *disagree* on. Thus, for example, the
dissimilarity between Apple and Orange is 1 (an apple is crunchy and
an orange is not, but they agree on everything else). Calculate the
dissimilarity between each pair of fruits, and make a square table
that summarizes the results. (To save yourself some work, note that
the dissimilarity between a fruit and itself must be zero, and the
dissimilarity between fruits A and B is the same as that between B
and A.) Save your table of dissimilarities into a file for the next part.
 

(c) Do a hierarchical cluster analysis using complete
linkage. Display your dendrogram.
 

(d) How many clusters, of what fruits, do you seem to have?
Explain briefly.
 

(e) Pick a pair of clusters (with at least 2 fruits in each)
from your dendrogram. Verify that 
the complete-linkage distance on your dendrogram is correct.
