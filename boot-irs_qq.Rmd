## Bootstrapping the IRS data

 You might recall the IRS data from when we were learning about the sign test. The idea was that we wanted to see how long "on average" it took people to fill out a tax form. The data are in \url{http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/irs.txt}.



(a) Read in and display (some of) the data. There is only one column of data, so you can pretend the values are separated by anything.



(b) Obtain a bootstrap distribution of the sample *median*.



(c) Make a suitable graph of the bootstrap distribution of the median. What seems odd about it? Why did that happen? (Hint: use more bins on your plot than usual, like 50.)



(d) Find 95% percentile and bootstrap-$t$ intervals for the population median. (Hint: your dataframe of bootstrapped medians may still be `rowwise`, so you might need to run `ungroup` first.)
