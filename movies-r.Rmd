##  Movie ratings and lengths


 Before a movie is shown in theatres, it
receives a "rating" that says what kind of material it
contains. [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system)
explains the categories, from G (suitable for children) to R (anyone
under 17 must be accompanied by parent/guardian). In 2011, two
students collected data on the length (in minutes) and the rating
category, for 15 movies of each rating category, randomly chosen from
all the movies released that year. The data are at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/movie-lengths.csv).



(a) Read the data into R, and display (some of) what you read in.


Solution


`read_csv`:
```{r }
my_url <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/movie-lengths.csv"
movies <- read_csv(my_url)
movies
```

     

Something that looks like a length in minutes, and a rating.



(b) Count how many movies there are of each rating.


Solution


```{r }
movies %>% count(rating)
```

       

Fifteen of each rating. (It's common to have the same number of
observations in each group, but not necessary for a one-way ANOVA.)



(c) Carry out an ANOVA and a Tukey
analysis (if warranted).
  


Solution


ANOVA first:

```{r }
length.1 <- aov(length ~ rating, data = movies)
summary(length.1)
```

 

This P-value is 0.00000459, which is way less than 0.05.

Having rejected the null (which said "all means equal"), we now need to
do Tukey, thus:

```{r }
TukeyHSD(length.1)
```

 

Cast your eye down the `p adj` column and look for the ones
that are significant, here the first three. These are all comparisons
with the G ("general") movies, which are shorter on average than the
others (which are not significantly different from each other).

If you like, you can make a table of means to verify that:

```{r }
movies %>%
  group_by(rating) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(length))
```

 

When we do this problem in SAS, you'll see the Tukey get handled a
different way, one that you might find more appealing.
  

(d) Make a graph to assess whether this ANOVA is
trustworthy. Discuss your graph and its implications briefly.


Solution


The obvious graph is a boxplot:
```{r }
ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating, y = length)) + geom_boxplot()
```

       

For ANOVA, we are looking for approximately normal distributions
within each group and approximately equal spreads. Without the
outliers, I would be more or less happy with that, but the G movies
have a low outlier that would pull the mean down and the PG and PG-13
movies have outliers that would pull the mean up. So a comparison of
means might make the differences look more significant than they
should. Having said that, you could also say that the ANOVA is
*very* significant, so even considering the effect of the
outliers, the differences between G and the others are still likely to
be significant. 

Extra: the way to go if you don't trust the ANOVA is (as for the
two-sample $t$) the Mood's median test. This applies to any number of
groups, and works in the same way as before:

```{r }
library(smmr)
median_test(movies, length, rating)
```

 

Still significant, though not quite as small a P-value as before
(which echoes our thoughts about what the outliers might do to the
means). If you look at the table above the test results, you see that
the G movies are mostly shorter than the overall median, but now the
PG-13 movies are mostly *longer*. So the picture is a little
different. 

Mood's median test does not naturally come with something like Tukey.
What you can do is to do all the pairwise Mood's median tests, between
each pair of groups, and then adjust to allow for your having done
several tests at once. I thought this was generally useful enough that
I put it into `smmr` under the name `pairwise_median_test`:

```{r }
pairwise_median_test(movies, length, rating)
```

 

You can ignore those (adjusted) P-values rather stupidly bigger than
1. These are not significant.

There are two significant differences in median length: between G
movies and the two flavours of PG movies. The G movies are
significantly shorter (as you can tell from the boxplot), but the
difference between G and R movies is no longer significant (a change
from the regular ANOVA). 

You may be puzzled by something in the boxplot: how is it that the G
movies are significantly shorter than the PG movies, but not
significantly shorter than the R movies, \emph{when the difference in
medians between G and R movies is bigger}? In Tukey, if the
difference in means is bigger, the P-value is
smaller.
`r tufte::margin_note("Actually, this doesn't always work if the sample  sizes in each group are different. If you're comparing two small  groups, it takes a *very large* difference in means to get a  small P-value. But in this case the sample sizes are all the same.")`
The resolution to this puzzle, such as it is, is that Mood's median
test is not directly comparing the medians of the groups (despite its
name); it's counting values above and below a *joint* median,
which might be a different story.
