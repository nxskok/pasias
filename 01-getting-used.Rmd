# Getting used to R and R Studio

My solutions follow the problems. Look ahead if you get stuck. Don't forget `library(tidyverse)` if you need it:

```{r, child="packages.Rmd"}
```


```{r, child="r-signup_qq.Rmd"}
```

```{r, child="r0_qq.Rmd"}
```

```{r, child="r0a_qq.Rmd"}
```

```{r different-ways, child="different-ways_qq.Rmd"}
```

My solutions follow: 

```{r, child="r-signup.Rmd"}
```

```{r, child="r0.Rmd"}
```

```{r, child="r0a.Rmd"}
```

```{r different-ways, child="different-ways.Rmd"}
```
