##  Rainfall in California


 The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/calirain.txt) are
rainfall and other measurements for 30 weather stations in
California. Our aim is to understand how well the annual rainfall at
these stations (measured in inches) can be predicted from the other
measurements, which are the altitude (in feet above sea level), the
latitude (degrees north of the equator) and the distance from the
coast (in miles).



(a) Read the data into R. You'll have to be careful here, since the
values are space-delimited, but sometimes by more than one space, to
make the columns line up.  `read_table2`, with filename or
url, will read it in.
One of the variables
is called `rainfall`, so as long as you *do not* call
the data frame that, you should be safe.



(b) Make a boxplot of the rainfall figures, and explain why the
values are reasonable. (A rainfall cannot be negative, and it is
unusual for a annual rainfall to exceed 60 inches.) A
`ggplot` boxplot needs *something* on the $x$-axis: the
number 1 will do.



(c) Plot `rainfall` against each of the other quantitative
variables (that is, not `station`). 



(d) Look at the relationship of each other variable with
`rainfall`. 
Justify the assertion that `latitude` seems most strongly
related with `rainfall`. Is that relationship positive or negative? linear? Explain
briefly. 



(e) Fit a regression with `rainfall` as the response
variable, and `latitude` as your explanatory variable. What
are the intercept, slope and R-squared values? Is there a 
*significant* relationship between `rainfall` and your
explanatory variable? What does that mean?



(f) Fit a multiple regression predicting `rainfall` from
all three of the other (quantitative) variables. Display the
results. Comment is coming up later.



(g) What is the R-squared for the regression of the last part?
How does that compare with the R-squared of your regression in part (e)?



(h) What do you conclude about the importance of the variables
that you did *not* include in your model in
(e)? Explain briefly.



(i) Make a suitable hypothesis test that the variables
`altitude` and `fromcoast` significantly improve the
prediction of `rainfall` over the use of `latitude`
alone. What do you conclude?
