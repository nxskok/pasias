##  Trying on shirts


 Does it make a difference if you see somebody else trying on
a shirt before you do, and if so, does it matter what kind of person
it is? 

An experiment was carried out in a university bookstore, with
students who wanted to try on a shirt serving as (unsuspecting)
experimental subjects. When a student wanted to try on a shirt, the
sales associate told them that there was only one shirt left, and it
was being tried on by an "other customer". This "other customer"
was actually a "confederate" of the experimenter (that means, they
were pretending to be a real customer but were actually part of the
experiment). The "other customer" was always female: either an
attractive well-dressed model, or an average-looking student wearing
jeans. The "other customer" would come out of the
dressing room and hand the shirt to the sales associate, who would
give it to the student who wanted to try it on. When the student had
tried on the shirt, they were asked to rate it on a 7-point scale (on
five different dimensions, and those five scores were then
averaged). Does a student's evaluation depend on whether the student
was male or female, and whether the "other customer" was a model or
a student? There was also a control group, where the student was
handed the shirt directly  by the sales associate, without the 
"other customer" being involved at all. 

There were thus five treatments:
male students who saw a model, male students who saw a student, female
students who saw a model, female students who saw a student, and the
control group. There were 25 students in each treatment group.

The data from this experiment can be found at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/shirts.csv).



(a) Read in and display the data. How many observations do you
have, and is that what you should have?


(b) Turn `treatment` into a `factor` in your data
frame. (You can use the same name as the text `treatment`
that you read in from the file.)


(c) List the treatments in the order that they are in within
your `factor`. (There are lots of ways to do this; any one of
them except for `distinct` is good.)


(d) <a name="part:mean-eval">*</a> 
Obtain a table of mean evaluation scores for each treatment group.
  


(e) The experimenters wanted to compare four specific things in
their analysis:


* evaluation scores between male students who saw a (female) model and
male students who saw a (female) student

* evaluation scores between female students who saw a (female)
model and female students who saw a (female) student

* evaluation scores for male and for female students (overall)

* evaluation scores for the (average of the) four genuine
treatments and for the control group

Create contrasts, with suitable names, using vectors with
appropriate values.
  


(f) Pick two of your contrasts (doesn't matter which two) and
demonstrate that they are orthogonal.
  


(g) Collect all your contrasts together into a matrix and
declare that they are contrasts for `treatment` within your
data frame (whatever you called it).
  


(h) Predict evaluation score from 
treatment *as a  regression*, and display the results.
  


(i) For each of your contrasts, assess whether or not it is
significant, and explain briefly what that means in the context of the
data. If a contrast is significant, use your answer to
part (<a href="#part:mean-eval">here</a>) to help in your interpretation.
