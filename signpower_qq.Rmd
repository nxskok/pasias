##  The power of the sign test


 I've mentioned several times that the sign test has less
power than the $t$-test. Let's investigate this with a specific example.

Let's suppose we are testing $H_0: \mu=40$ against $H_a: \mu \ne 40$,
where $\mu$ is the population mean (and median, as we shall see). Our
population actually has a normal distribution with mean 50 and SD 15,
so that the null hypothesis is *wrong* and we want to reject it
most of the time. On the other hand, the population actually *is*
normally-distributed and so the $t$-test is the right one to use.

(This is an old question, so I tackle the simulated power differently
than I did it in class this time. But see if you can follow what I do
here.)



(a) Use `power.t.test` to find the probability that a
$t$-test correctly rejects the null hypothesis using a sample size
of $n=10$.



(b) What code in R would draw a random sample of size 10 from the
*true* population distribution and save the sample in a variable?




(c) What code would count how many of the sampled values are less
than 40 and how many are greater (or equal)? 




(d) It turns out the sign test would reject $H_0: M=40$ against
$H_a: M \ne 40$ at $\alpha=0.05$ if the smaller of the numbers in the
last part is 1 or less. ($M$ is the population median.) 
Add to your pipeline to obtain `TRUE`
if you should reject the null for your
data and `FALSE` otherwise. 




(e) Simulate the above process 1000 times:
draw a random sample from a normal distribution of size 10 with mean 50 and SD
15, count the number of values below 40, reject if the
minimum of those is 0, 1, 9, or 10, then count the number of rejections
out of 1000.




(f) Which is more powerful in this case, the sign test or the
$t$-test? How do you know?
