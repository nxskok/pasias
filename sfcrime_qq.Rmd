##  Crimes in San Francisco



The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/sfcrime1.csv) is a subset
of a huge
dataset of crimes committed in San Francisco between 2003 and
2015. The variables are:



* `Dates`: the date and time of the crime

* `Category`: the category of crime, eg. "larceny" or
"vandalism" (response).

* `Descript`: detailed description of crime.

* `DayOfWeek`: the day of the week of the crime.

* `PdDistrict`: the name of the San Francisco Police
Department district in which the crime took place.

* `Resolution`: how the crime was resolved

* `Address`: approximate street address of crime

* `X`: longitude

* `Y`: latitude


Our aim is to see whether the category of crime depends on the day of
the week and the district in which it occurred. However, there are a
lot of crime categories, so we will focus on the top four
"interesting" ones, which are the ones included in this data file.

Some of the model-fitting takes a while (you'll see why below). If
you're using R Markdown, you can wait for the models to fit each time
you re-run your document, or insert `cache=T` in the top line
of your code chunk (the one with `r` in curly brackets in it,
above the actual code). Put a comma and the `cache=T` inside
the curly brackets.  What that does is to re-run that code chunk only
if it changes; if it hasn't changed it will use the saved results from
last time it was run. That can save you a lot of waiting around.



(a) Read in the data and display the dataset (or, at least,
part of it).



(b) Fit a multinomial logistic
regression that predicts crime category from day of week and
district. (You don't need to look at it.) The model-fitting produces
some output. (If you're using R Markdown, that will
come with it.)




(c) Fit a model that predicts Category from only the
district. Hand in the output from the fitting process as well. 




(d) Use `anova` to compare the two models you just
obtained. What does the `anova` tell you?




(e) Using your preferred model, obtain predicted probabilities
that a crime will be of each of these four categories for each day of
the week in the `TENDERLOIN` district (the name is ALL
CAPS). This will mean constructing a data frame to predict from,
obtaining the predictions and then displaying them suitably.




(f) Describe briefly how the weekend days Saturday and Sunday
differ from the rest.
