##  Grouping similar cars


 The file
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/car-cluster.csv) contains
information on seven variables 
for 32 different cars. The variables are:



* `Carname`: name of the car (duh!)

* `mpg`: gas consumption in miles per US gallon (higher means the car uses less gas)

* `disp`: engine displacement (total volume of cylinders in engine): higher is more powerful

* `hp`: engine horsepower (higher means a more powerful engine)

* `drat`: rear axle ratio (higher means more powerful but worse gas mileage)

* `wt`: car weight in US tons

* `qsec`: time needed for the car to cover a quarter mile (lower means faster)




(a) Read in the data and display its structure. Do you have the
right number of cars and variables?


(b) The variables are all measured on different scales. Use
`scale` to produce a matrix of standardized ($z$-score) values
for the columns of your data that are numbers.




(c) Run a K-means cluster analysis for these data, obtaining 3
clusters, and display the results. Take whatever action you need to
obtain the best (random) result from a number of runs.




(d) Display the car names together with which cluster they are
in. If you display them all at once, sort by cluster so that it's
easier to see which clusters contain which cars. (You may have to make
a data frame first.)




(e) I have no idea whether 3 is a sensible number of clusters. To
find out, we will draw a scree plot (in a moment). Write a function
that accepts the number of clusters and the (scaled) data,
and returns the total within-cluster sum of squares.




(f) Calculate the total within-group sum of squares for each
number of clusters from 2 to 10, using the function you just wrote.




(g) Make a scree plot, using the total within-cluster sums of
squares values that you calculated in the previous part. 




(h) What is a suitable number of clusters for K-means, based on
your scree plot?




(i) Run a K-means analysis using the number of clusters suggested
by your scree plot, and list the car names together with the clusters
they belong to, *sorted by cluster*.
