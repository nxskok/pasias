##  College plans


 5199 male high school seniors in Wisconsin
`r tufte::margin_note("I don't  know why Wisconsin again, but that's what it is.")` were classified by
socio-economic status (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, high), by
the degree that their parents encouraged them in their education (low
or high),
and whether or not they had plans to go to college (yes or no). How,
if at all, are these categorical variables related? The data can be
found at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/college-plans.txt). 



(a) Read in the data and check that you have a column for each
variable and a column of frequencies.


(b) Fit a log-linear model containing all possible
interactions. You don't need to examine it yet.


(c) Find out which terms (interactions) could be removed. Do you
think removing any of them is a good idea?



(d) Remove anything you can, and fit again. Hint: `update`.



(e) Continue to examine what can be removed, and if reasonable,
remove it, until you need to stop. Which terms are left in your final model?



(f) Make two-way tables of any remaining two-way interactions, and
describe any relationships that you see.
