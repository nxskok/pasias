##  Carbon monoxide in cigarettes


 The (US) Federal Trade Commission assesses cigarettes
according to their tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide contents. In a
particular year, 25 brands were assessed. For each brand, the tar,
nicotine and carbon monoxide (all in milligrams) were measured, along
with the weight in grams. Our aim is to predict carbon monoxide from
any or all of the other variables. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ftccigar.txt). These are
aligned by column (except for the variable names), with more than one
space between each column of data.


(a) Read the data into R, and check that you have 25 observations
and 4 variables.



(b) Run a regression to predict carbon monoxide from the other
variables, and obtain a summary of the output.



(c) Which one of your explanatory variables would you
remove from this regression? Explain (very) briefly. Go ahead and
fit the regression  without it, and describe how the change in
R-squared from the regression in (b) was entirely predictable.



(d) Fit a regression predicting carbon monoxide from
`nicotine` *only*, and display the summary.



(e) `nicotine` was far from being significant in the model
of (c), and yet in the model of
(d), it was *strongly* significant, and the
R-squared value of (d) was almost as high as that
of (c). What does this say about the importance of
`nicotine` as an explanatory variable? Explain, as briefly as
you can manage.



(f) Make a "pairs plot": that is, scatter plots between all
pairs of variables. This can be done by feeding the whole data frame
into `plot`.^[This is a base graphics graph rather than a `ggplot` one, but it will do for our purposes.]
Do you see any strong relationships that do
*not* include `co`? Does that shed any light on the last
part? Explain briefly (or "at length" if that's how it comes
out).
