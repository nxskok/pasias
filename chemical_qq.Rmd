##  Handling shipments of chemicals


 The data in
[link](http://statweb.lsu.edu/EXSTWeb/StatLab/DataSets/NKNWData/CH06PR09.txt)
are on shipments of chemicals in drums that arrive at a warehouse. In
order, the variables are:


* the number of minutes required to handle the shipment

* the number of drums in the shipment

* the total weight of the shipment, in hundreds of pounds.




(a) The data set has two features: *no* column names, and
data aligned in columns (that is, more than one space between data
values). Read the data in, giving the columns suitable names. To do
this, you may have to consult an appropriate help file, or do some
searching, perhaps of one of the other questions on this assignment.



(b) Fit a regression predicting the number of minutes required
to handle a shipment from the other two variables. Display the results.



(c) Explain carefully but briefly what the slope coefficients
for the two explanatory variables represent. Do their signs
(positive or negative) make practical sense in the context of
handling shipments of chemicals?



(d) Obtain plots of residuals against fitted values, residuals
against explanatory variables, and a normal quantile plot of the residuals.



(e) Do you have any concerns, looking at the residual plots?
Explain briefly.
