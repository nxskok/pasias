##  Air pollution


 The data in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/airpollution.csv) are
measurements of air-pollution variables recorded at 12 noon on 42
different days at a location in Los Angeles. The file is in
`.csv` format, since it came from a spreadsheet.  Specifically,
the variables (in suitable units), in the same order as in the data
file, are:



* wind speed

* solar radiation

* carbon monoxide

* Nitric oxide (also known as nitrogen monoxide)

* Nitrogen dioxide

* Ozone

* Hydrocarbons


The aim is to describe pollution using fewer than these seven variables.



(a) Read in the data and demonstrate that you have the right
number of rows and columns in your data frame.



(b) <a name="part:fivenum">*</a> 
Obtain a five-number summary for each variable. You can do this in
one go for all seven variables.



(c) Obtain a principal components analysis. Do it on the
correlation matrix, since the variables are measured on different
scales. You don't need to look at the results yet.



(d) Obtain a scree plot. How many principal components might be
worth looking at? Explain briefly. (There might be more than one
possibility. If so, discuss them all.)



(e) Look at the `summary` of the principal components
object. What light does this shed on the choice of number of
components? Explain briefly.



(f) <a name="part:preferred">*</a> How do each of your preferred number of components depend
on the variables that were measured? Explain briefly.



(g) Make a data frame that contains (i) the original data, (ii) a column of row numbers, (iii) the principal component scores. Display some of it.


(h) Display the row of your new data frame for the observation
with the smallest (most negative) score on component 1. Which row is
this? What makes this observation have the most negative score on
component 1?


(i) Which observation has the lowest (most negative) value on
component 2? Which variables ought to be high or low for this
observation? Are they? Explain briefly.


(j) Obtain a biplot, with the row numbers labelled, and explain briefly how your conclusions from the previous two parts are consistent with it.


(k) Run a factor analysis on the same data, obtaining two factors. Look at the factor loadings. Is it clearer which variables belong to which factor, compared to the principal components analysis? Explain briefly.
