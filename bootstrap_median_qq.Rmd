##  Air conditioning failures: bootstrapping the median


 With a skewed data distribution such as the air-conditioning
failure times, we might be interested in inference for the median. One
way to get a confidence interval for the median is to invert the sign
test, as in `smmr`, but another way is to obtain a bootstrap
sampling distribution for the median. How do these approaches compare
for the air-conditioning data? We explore this here.



(a) Read in the air-conditioning data again (if you don't already
have it lying around). The link is in the previous question.


(b) Use `smmr` to get a confidence interval for the median (based on the sign test).


(c) Obtain the bootstrap distribution of the sample median. Make a normal quantile plot of it. What do you notice? Explain briefly.


(d) Obtain a 95\% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the median. How does it compare with the one you obtained earlier?


(e) Obtain a 95\% BCa interval. Compare it with the two other intervals you found.
