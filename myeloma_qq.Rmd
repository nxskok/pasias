##  Multiple myeloma


 Multiple myeloma is a kind of cancer. It
forms in a plasma cell (which is a type of white blood cell). It
causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow, where they crowd
out healthy blood cells. Plasma cells make antibodies (to help fight
infections), while the cancer cells don't: they produce abnormal
proteins that can cause kidney problems. (This adapted from
[link](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/basics/definition/con-20026607).)
The variables are:



* `time`: survival time from diagnosis (months)

* `vstatus`: 0=alive, 1=dead at end of study

* `logbun`: log of BUN test score (BUN test is a test of
kidney function, not to be confused with cha siu
bao
`r tufte::margin_note("Barbecued pork in a bun. A staple of Chinese dim sum and  Chinese bakeries, such as Ding Dong bakery on Spadina.")`).

* `hgb`: hemoglobin (at diagnosis).

* `platelet`: platelets: 1=normal, 0=abnormal (at
diagnosis).

* `age` at diagnosis, in years

* `logwbc`: log of WBC (white blood cell count, at
diagnosis)

* `frac`: fractures at diagnosis (0=absent, 1=present)

* `logpbm`: log of percent of plasma cells in bone marrow

* `protein`: proteinuria (protein in urine) at
diagnosis. Most people have very little, so a larger than normal
amount indicates illness of some kind.

* `scalc`: serum calcium at diagnosis.


The data, on 65 patients with multiple myeloma, are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/myeloma.csv). Some of the
variables are logs because they could take very large values.

There are a lot of parts here, but each part is supposed to be short.



(a) Read in the data and display (some of) the values. Confirm that
you have the right number of observations and the right variables.



(b) Create a suitable response variable for a Cox
proportional-hazards survival model, bearing in mind that the
"event" here is death. Display your response variable, and explain
briefly what the `+` signs attached to some of the values
mean, without using a technical term.



(c) What is the technical term for those patients that have a
`+` by their values for the response variable?



(d) Fit a Cox proportional-hazards survival model predicting
your response variable from all the other variables (except for the
ones that you used to make the response variable). Display the
`summary` of your model.



(e) In your model, which explanatory variables have a P-value less than
0.10? Fit a model containing only those and display the results.



(f) Do a test to compare the two models that you fit. Why do 
you prefer the second model? Explain briefly.



(g) There should be two explanatory variables left in your
model. These are both numerical variables. Find their first and
third quartiles, any way you like.



(h) Create a data frame containing all possible combinations
of the two quartiles for each of the two variables, and display the result.



(i) Obtain predicted survival probabilities for each of the
combinations of variables you created above. You don't need to look
at the results (they are rather long).



(j) Obtain a graph of the predicted survival curves for each
combination of your variables.



(k) Is it better to have high or low values for each of the
variables in your prediction? Explain briefly.
