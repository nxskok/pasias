##  The brain of a cat


 A large number (315) of psychology students were asked to
imagine that they were serving on a university ethics committee
hearing a complaint against animal research being done by a member of
the faculty. The students were told that the surgery consisted of
implanting a device called a cannula in each cat's brain, through
which chemicals were introduced into the brain and the cats were then
given psychological tests. At the end of the study, the cats' brains
were subjected to histological analysis. The complaint asked that the
researcher's authorization to carry out the study should be withdrawn,
and the cats should be handed over to the animal rights group that
filed the complaint. It was suggested that the research could just as
well be done with computer simulations.

All of the psychology students in the survey were told all of this. In
addition, they read a statement by the researcher that no animal felt
much pain at any time, and that computer simulation was *not* an
adequate substitute for animal research. Each student was also given
*one* of the following scenarios that explained the benefit of
the research:



* "cosmetic": testing the toxicity of chemicals to be used in
new lines of hair care products.

* "theory": evaluating two competing theories about the function
of a particular nucleus in the brain.

* "meat": testing a synthetic growth hormone said to potentially
increase meat production.

* "veterinary": attempting to find a cure for a brain disease
that is killing domesticated cats and endangered species of wild cats.

* "medical": evaluating a potential cure for a debilitating
disease that afflicts many young adult humans.


Finally, each student completed two questionnaires: one that would assess their
"relativism": whether or not they believe in universal moral
principles (low score) or whether they believed that the appropriate
action depends on the person and situation (high score). The second
questionnaire assessed "idealism": a high score reflects a belief
that ethical behaviour will always lead to good consequences (and thus
that  if a behaviour leads to any bad consequences at all, it is
unethical).^[I get confused about the difference between morals  and ethics. [This is a very short description of that difference:] (http://smallbusiness.chron.com/differences-between-ethical-issues-moral-issues-business-48134.html). The basic idea is that morals are part of who you are, derived from religion, philosophy etc. Ethics are how you act in a particular situation: that is, your morals, what you believe, inform your ethics, what you do. That's why the students had to play the role of an  ethics committee, rather than a morals committee; presumably the researcher had good morals, but an ethics committee had to evaluate what he was planning to do, rather than his character as a person.]

After being exposed to all of that, each student stated their decision
about whether the research should continue or stop.

I should perhaps stress at this point that no actual cats were harmed
in the collection of these data (which can be found as a `.csv`
file at
[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/decision.csv)). The
variables in the data set are these:



* `decision`: whether the research should continue or stop (response)

* `idealism`: score on idealism questionnaire

* `relativism`: score on relativism questionnaire

* `gender` of student

* `scenario` of research benefits that the student read.


A more detailed discussion^("[If you can believe it.] of this
study is at
[link](http://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/MV/Multreg/Logistic-SPSS.PDF). 


(a) Read in the data and check by looking at the structure of
your data frame that you have something sensible. *Do not* call
your data frame `decision`, since that's the name of one of
the variables in it.



(b) Fit a logistic regression predicting
`decision` from `gender`. Is there an effect of gender?



(c) To investigate the effect (or non-effect) of
`gender`, create a contingency table by feeding
`decision` and `gender` into `table`. What does
this tell you?



(d) <a name="part:whichprob">*</a> Is your slope for `gender` in the previous logistic
regression positive or negative? Is it applying to males or to females?
Looking at the conclusions from your 
contingency table, what probability does that mean your logistic
regression is actually modelling?



(e) Add the two variables `idealism` and
`relativism` to your logistic regression. Do either or both of them add
significantly to your model? Explain briefly.

 

(f) Add the variable `scenario` to your model. That is,
fit a new model with that variable plus all the others.



(g) Use `anova` to compare the models with and without
`scenario`. You'll have to add a `test="Chisq"` to your
`anova`, to make sure that the test gets done.
Does `scenario` make a difference or not, at $\alpha=0.10$?
Explain briefly.
(The reason we have to do it this way is that
`scenario` is a factor with five levels, so it has four slope
coefficients. To test them all at once, which is what we need to make
an overall test for `scenario`, this is the way it has to be
done.) 



(h) Look at the `summary` of your model that contained
`scenario`. Bearing in mind that the slope coefficient for
`scenariocosmetic` is zero (since this is the first scenario
alphabetically), which scenarios have the most positive and most
negative slope coefficients? What does that tell you about those
scenarios' effects?

 

(i) Describe the effects that having (i) a higher idealism score
and (ii) a higher relativity score have on a person's probability of
saying that the research should stop. Do each of these increase or decrease
that probability? Explain briefly.
