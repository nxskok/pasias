##  Social interaction among old people


 A graduate student wrote a thesis comparing different
treatments for increasing social interaction among geriatric
patients. He recruited 21 patients at a state mental hospital and
randomly assigned them to treatments: Reality Orientation
(`ro`), Behavior Therapy (`bt`) or no treatment
(`ctrl`). Each subject was observed at four times, labelled
`t1` through `t4` in the data file
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/geriatrics.txt). The
response variable was the percentage of time that the subject was
"engaging in the relevant social interaction", so that a higher
value is better.

The principal aim of the study was to see whether there were
differences among the treatments (one would hope that the real
treatments were better than the control one), and whether there were
any patterns over time.



(a) Read in the data and display at least some of it.



(b) Create a response variable and fit a suitable `lm`
as the first stage of the repeated-measures analysis.



(c) Run a suitable `Manova`. There is some setup
first. Make sure you do that.



(d) Display the results of your repeated-measures
analysis. What do you conclude? Explain briefly.



(e) To understand the results that you got from the repeated
measures analysis, you are going to draw a picture (or two). To do
*that*, we are going to need the data in "long" format with
one response value per line (instead of four). Use `pivot_longer`
suitably to get the data in that format, and demonstrate that you
have done so.



(f) Calculate and save the mean interaction percents for each
time-treatment combination.



(g) Make an interaction plot. Arrange things so that time goes
across the page. Use your data frame of means that you just calculated.



(h) Describe what you see on your interaction plot, and what it
says about why your repeated-measures analysis came out as it did.



(i) Draw a spaghetti plot of these data. That is, use
`ggplot` to plot the interaction percent against time for
each subject,
joining the points for the *same subject* by lines whose colour
shows what treatment they were on. Use the "long" data frame for
this (not the data frame of means).
