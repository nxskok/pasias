##  Measuring body fat


 Athletes are concerned with measuring their body fat
percentage. Two different methods are available: one using ultrasound,
and the other using X-ray technology. We are interested in whether
there is a difference in the mean body fat percentage as measured by
these two methods, and if so, how big that difference is. Data on 16
athletes are at

(a) Explain briefly why a matched pairs analysis is more
suitable for these data than a two-independent-samples analysis
(using a two-sample $t$-test). You might find that looking at the
data (clicking on the link) helps you figure this out.



(b) Read in the data and check that you have a sensible number of
rows and columns.




(c) Carry out a suitable test to determine whether the means are
the same or different. (At this point, obtain the R output including a P-value.)




(d) What do you conclude from the test?




(e) Obtain a 95\% confidence interval for the population mean
difference. How is the interval consistent with your test?




(f) Calculate the differences, and make a normal quantile plot of
them. Is there any evidence that normality of differences fails?
Explain briefly.
