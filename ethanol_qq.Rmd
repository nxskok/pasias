##  Ethanol and sleep time in rats


 A biologist wished to study the effects of ethanol on sleep
time in rats. A sample of 20 rats (all the same age) was selected, and
each rat was given an injection having a particular concentration (0,
1, 2 or 4 grams per kilogram of body weight) of ethanol. These are
labelled `e0, e1, e2, e4`. The "0"
treatment was a control group. The rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time
was then recorded for each rat. The data are in
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ratsleep.txt). 



(a) Read the data in from the file. Check that you have four rows
of observations  and five columns of sleep times.



(b) Unfortunately, the data are in the wrong format. All the sleep
times for each treatment group are on one row, and we should have
*one* column containing *all* the sleep times, and the
corresponding row should show which treatment group that sleep time
came from. Transform this data frame into one that you could use for modelling or making graphs.






(c) Using your new data frame, make side-by-side boxplots of sleep
time by treatment group. 





(d) In your boxplots, how does the median sleep time appear to
depend on treatment group?




(e) There is an assumption about spread that the analysis of
variance needs in order to be reliable. Do your boxplots indicate that
this assumption is satisfied for these data, bearing in mind that you
have only five observations per group?




(f) Run an analysis of variance to see whether sleep time differs
significantly among treatment groups. What do you conclude?




(g) Would it be a good idea to run Tukey's method here? Explain
briefly why or why not, and if you think it would be a good idea, run
it.




(h) What do you conclude from Tukey's method? (This is liable to be
a bit complicated.) Is there a treatment that is clearly best, in
terms of the sleep time being largest?
