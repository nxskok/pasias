##  Getting an R Studio Cloud account


 Follow these steps to get an R Studio Cloud account.



(a) Point your web browser at [rstudio.cloud](rstudio.cloud). (If you already
have R and R Studio installed on your computer, you can use that
instead, throughout the course; just do part (d) of this
question. Any references to R Studio Cloud in this assignment also
apply to R Studio on your computer.)

Solution


You should see this:

. Click
on Get Started. You might instead see the screen in the next part.


(b) Choose an account to use.

Solution


Here's what you should see now:

If you're happy with using your Google account, click that
button. You will probably have to enter your Google password. (If
you are doing this on your own computer, you might not have to do
that.) If you have a GitHub account and you want to use
*that*, same principle.
You can also use an email address as your login to R Studio
Cloud. (You can use any e-mail address; I'm not checking.) Enter
it in the top box, and enter a password to use with R Studio Cloud
in the second. (This does not have to be, and indeed probably
should not be, the same as your email password.)  Below that,
enter your first and last name. This will appear at the top right
of the screen when you are logged in. Then click Sign Up. After
that, you will have to make a unique account name (which
*you* actually never use, but ``rstudio.cloud+ uses to
name your files).
After that, you are automatically logged in.


(c) Take a look around, and create a new Project. Give the new
project any name you like.

Solution


This is what you see now:

Click on the blue New Project button to create a new Project. (A
project is a self-contained piece of work, like for example an
assignment.)
You will see the words "Loading Project" and spinning circles
for a few moments. Then you see this:

To give your project a name, click at the top where it says
Untitled Project and type a name like Assignment 0 into the box.


(d) Before we get to work, look for the blue `>` at the
bottom left. Click next to it to get a flashing cursor, and then
type what you see here (in blue):

Then press Enter.

Solution


This lets it install a bunch of things. It may take some
time. If you are watching it, look out for lines beginning with
`g++`, which are C++ code that needs to be compiled. This is
the end of what I had. Look out for the word DONE near the bottom:

(e) Not for now, but for later: if you are on a lab computer, you
should probably log out when you are done. To do that, find your
name at the top right. Click on it, and two things should pop out to
the right: Profile and Log Out. Select Log Out. You should be
returned to one of the screens you began with, possibly the Welcome
to R Studio Cloud one. 
To log back in, now or next time, look for
Log In at the top right. Click it, to get this:

and then you can log in with your email and password, or Google or
Github IDs, whichever you used.
Now we can get down to some actual work.
