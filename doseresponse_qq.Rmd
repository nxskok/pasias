##  The effects of Substance A


 In a dose-response experiment, animals (or
cell cultures or human subjects) are exposed to some toxic substance,
and we observe how many of them show some sort of response. In this
experiment, a mysterious Substance A is exposed at various doses to
100 cells at each dose, and the number of cells at each dose that
suffer damage is recorded. The doses were 10, 20, ... 70 (mg), and
the number of damaged cells out of 100 were respectively 10, 28, 53,
77, 91, 98, 99.



(a) Find a way to get these data into R, and show that you have
managed to do so successfully.



(b) Would you expect to see a significant effect of dose for
these data?
Explain briefly.



(c) Fit a logistic regression modelling the probability of a
cell being damaged as it depends on dose. Display the
results. (Comment on them is coming later.)



(d) Does your output indicate that the probability of damage
really does *increase* with dose? (There are two things here:
is there really an effect, and which way does it go?)



(e) Obtain predicted damage probabilities for some representative doses. 



(f) Draw a graph of the predicted probabilities, and to that add the observed proportions of damage at each dose. Hints: you will have to calculate the observed proportions first. See [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/mfx01_predictions.html), near the bottom, to find out how to add data to one of these graphs. The `geom_point` line is the one you need.

Looking at  the predicted probabilities, would you say that
the model fits well? Explain briefly.
