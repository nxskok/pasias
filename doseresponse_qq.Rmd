##  The effects of Substance A


 In a dose-response experiment, animals (or
cell cultures or human subjects) are exposed to some toxic substance,
and we observe how many of them show some sort of response. In this
experiment, a mysterious Substance A is exposed at various doses to
100 cells at each dose, and the number of cells at each dose that
suffer damage is recorded. The doses were 10, 20, ... 70 (mg), and
the number of damaged cells out of 100 were respectively 10, 28, 53,
77, 91, 98, 99.



(a) Find a way to get these data into R, and show that you have
managed to do so successfully.



(b) Would you expect to see a significant effect of dose for
these data?
Explain briefly.



(c) Fit a logistic regression modelling the probability of a
cell being damaged as it depends on dose. Display the
results. (Comment on them is coming later.)



(d) Does your output indicate that the probability of damage
really does *increase* with dose? (There are two things here:
is there really an effect, and which way does it go?)



(e) Obtain predicted damage probabilities for the doses that
were actually used in the experiment. (This is easier than some of
our other predictions: if you are using the original data, you only
need to feed in the fitted model object and not a data frame of new
data.) Display your predicted probabilities next to the doses and
the observed numbers of damaged cells.



(f) Looking at  the predicted probabilities, would you say that
the model fits well? Explain briefly.
