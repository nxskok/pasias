##  Reading data from a file


 In this question, we read a file from the web and do some
descriptive statistics and a graph. This is very like what you will be
doing on future assignments, so it's good to practice it now.

Take a look at the data file at
[http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jumping.txt](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jumping.txt). These are
measurements on 30 rats that were randomly made to do different
amounts of jumping by group (we'll see the details later in the
course). The control group did no jumping, and the other groups did
"low jumping" and "high jumping". The first column says which
jumping group each rat was in, and the second is the rat's bone
density (the experimenters' supposition was that more jumping should
go with higher bone density).



(a) What are the two columns of data separated by? (The fancy word
is "delimited"). 


(b) Make a new R Notebook. Leave the first four lines, but get rid
of the rest of the template document. Start with a code chunk
containing `library(tidyverse)`. Run it.


(c) Put the URL of the data file in a variable called
`my_url`. Then use `read_delim` to read in the
file. (See solutions for how.) `read_delim` reads data files
where the data values are always separated by the same single
character, here a space. Save the data frame in a variable `rats`.


(d) Take a look at your data frame, by making a new code chunk and
putting the data frame's name in it (as we did with
`mtcars`). 


(e) Find the mean bone density for rats that did each amount of jumping.


(f) Make a boxplot of bone density for each jumping group.
