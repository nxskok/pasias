##  North Carolina births


 The data in file
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ncbirths.csv) are about
500 randomly chosen births of babies in North Carolina. There is a lot
of information: not just the weight at birth of the baby, but whether
the baby was born prematurely, the ages of the parents, whether the
parents are married, how long (in weeks) the pregnancy lasted (this is
called the "gestation") and so on. 



(a) Read in the data from the file into R, bearing in mind what
type of file it is. 



(b) From your output, verify that you have the
right number of observations and that you have several
variables. Which of your variables correspond to birthweight,
prematureness and length of pregnancy? (You might have to make guesses
based on the names of the variables.) 




(c) The theory behind the $t$-test (which we do later) says that the
distribution of birth weights should be (approximately) normally
distributed. Obtain a histogram of the birth weights. Does it look
approximately normal?  Comment briefly. (You'll have to pick a number
of bins for your histogram first. I don't mind very much what you
pick, as long as it's not obviously too many or too few bins.)
