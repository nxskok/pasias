##  Being satisfied with hospital


 A hospital administrator collects data to study the
effect, if any, of a patient's age, the severity of their
illness, and their anxiety level, on the patient's satisfaction with
their hospital experience. The data, in the file
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/satisfaction.txt), are
for 46 patients in a survey. The columns are: patient's satisfaction
score `satis`, on a scale of 0 to 100; the patient's `age` (in
years), the `severity` of the patient's illness (also on a
0--100 scale), and the patient's `anxiety` score on a standard
anxiety test (scale of 0--5). Higher scores mean greater satisfaction,
increased severity of illness and more anxiety.



(a) Read in the data and check that you have four columns in
your data frame, one for each of your variables.   
 

(b) <a name="part:scatmat">*</a> Obtain scatterplots of the response variable
`satis` against each of the other variables.
 

(c) In your scatterplots of (<a href="#part:scatmat">here</a>), which
relationship appears to be the strongest one?
 

(d) <a name="part:corrmat">*</a> Create a correlation matrix for all four 
variables. Does your strongest trend of the previous part have the
strongest correlation?
 

(e) Run a regression predicting satisfaction from the other
three variables, and display the output.
 

(f) Does the regression fit well overall? How can you tell?
 

(g) Test the null hypothesis that none of your explanatory
variables help, against the alternative that one or more of them
do. (You'll need an appropriate P-value. Which one is it?) What do
you conclude?
 

(h) The correlation between `severity` and
`satis` is not small, but in my regression I found that
`severity` was nowhere near significant. Why is this? Explain briefly.

(i) Carry out a backward elimination to determine which of
`age`, `severity` and `anxiety` are needed to
predict satisfaction. What do you get? Use $\alpha = 0.10$.
