##  Throwing baseballs and softballs, again


 Previously, you carried out a sign test to determine
whether students could throw a baseball farther than a softball. This
time, we will calculate a confidence interval for the median
difference baseball minus softball, using the results of sign tests.



(a) Read the data into R from
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/throw.txt), giving
appropriate names to the columns, and add a column of
differences. 



(b) Use `smmr` to find a 95\% confidence interval for the
median difference.



(c) What function in `smmr` will run a two-sided sign test
and return only the P-value? Check that it works by testing whether the
median difference for your data is zero or different from zero.



(d) Based on your P-value, do you think 0 is inside the confidence
interval or not? Explain briefly.



(e) Obtain a 95\% confidence interval for the population
median difference, baseball minus softball, using a
trial-and-error procedure that determines whether a number of
possible medians are inside or outside the CI.
