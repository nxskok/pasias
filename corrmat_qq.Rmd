##  A correlation matrix


 Here is a correlation matrix between five variables. This
correlation matrix was based on $n=50$ observations. Save the data
into a file.


```

1.00 0.90 -0.40 0.28 -0.05
0.90 1.00 -0.60 0.43 -0.20
-0.40 -0.60 1.00 -0.80 0.40
0.28 0.43 -0.80 1.00 -0.70
-0.05 -0.20 0.40 -0.70 1.00

```




(a) Read in the data, using `col_names=F` (why?). Check that you
have five variables with names invented by R.


(b) Run a principal components analysis from this correlation matrix.


(c) <a name="part:howmany">*</a> Obtain a scree plot. Can you justify
the use of two components (later, factors), bearing in mind that we
have only five variables?


(d) Take a look at the first two component loadings. Which variables appear
to feature in which component? Do they have a positive or negative effect?


(e) Create a "covariance list" (for the purposes of
performing a factor analysis on the correlation matrix).


(f) Carry out a factor analysis with two factors. We'll
investigate the bits of it in a 
moment.  


(g) <a name="part:load">*</a> Look at the factor loadings. Describe how the factors are
related to the original variables. Is the interpretation clearer
than for the principal components analysis?


(h) Look at the uniquenesses. Are there any that are unusually
high? Does that surprise you, given your answer to
(<a href="#part:load">here</a>)? (You will probably have to make a judgement call here.)
