##  Body fat as repeated measures


 This one is also stolen from STAC32. Athletes are concerned
with measuring their body fat percentage. Two different methods are
available: one using ultrasound, and the other using X-ray
technology. We are interested in whether there is a difference in the
mean body fat percentage as measured by these two methods, and if so,
how big that difference is. Data on 16 athletes are at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/bodyfat.txt).



(a) Read in the data and check that you have a sensible number of
rows and columns.




(b) Carry out a suitable (matched-pairs) $t$-test to determine
whether the means are the same or different. 






(c) What do you conclude from the test?




(d) Run a repeated-measures analysis of variance, treating the two
methods of measuring body fat as the repeated measures (ie., playing
the role of "time" that you have seen in most of the other repeated
measures analyses). There is no "treatment" here, so there is
nothing to go on the right side of the squiggle. Insert a `1`
there to mean "just an intercept". Display the results.





(e) Compare your repeated-measures analysis to your matched-pairs
one. Do you draw the same conclusions?
